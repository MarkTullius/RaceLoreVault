He closed the little notebook with a snap and pocketed it, “I really should receive more gratitude, I’d imagine other gods would respect their assassins a little more.” With that, Perin dropped off the wall into the darkness below.\\n**","ResourceType":"page","MediaType":{"mainType":"application","subType":"octet-stream","delimiter":".","firstSuffix":{"suffix":"","fullSuffix":""},"type":"application/octet-stream","string":"application/octet-stream","suffixes":[""]},"Permalink":"https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/110/","RelPermalink":"/RaceLoreVault/notes/110/","Name":"","Title":"","Params":{"draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00"},"Data":{},"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Lastmod":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00","PublishDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","ExpiryDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Aliases":null,"BundleType":"","Description":"","Draft":false,"IsHome":false,"Keywords":null,"Kind":"page","Layout":"","LinkTitle":"","IsNode":false,"IsPage":true,"Path":"notes/110.md","Pathc":"notes/110.md","Slug":"","Lang":"en","IsSection":false,"Section":"notes","SectionsEntries":["notes"],"SectionsPath":"notes","Sitemap":{"ChangeFreq":"","Priority":-1,"Filename":"sitemap.xml"},"Type":"notes","Weight":0,"Language":{"Lang":"en","LanguageName":"","LanguageDirection":"","Title":"","Weight":0,"Disabled":false,"ContentDir":"","Cfg":{},"LocalCfg":{},"Provider":{}},"File":{"File":{}},"GitInfo":{"hash":"02b026b58e3a0302e0fa6c9a0a86c9220f7e57eb","abbreviatedHash":"02b026b5","subject":"Move notes to the correct location","authorName":"MarkTullius","authorEmail":"mark_tullius91@gmail.com","authorDate":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00","commitDate":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00"},"OutputFormats":[{"Rel":"canonical","Format":{"mediaType":"text/html","name":"HTML","path":"","baseName":"index","rel":"canonical","protocol":"","isPlainText":false,"isHTML":true,"noUgly":false,"notAlternative":false,"permalinkable":true,"weight":10}}],"AlternativeOutputFormats":null,"Menus":null,"TranslationKey":"page/notes/110","IsTranslated":false,"AllTranslations":null,"Translations":null,"GetIdentity":{"Type":"content","Path":"notes/110.md"}},{"Content":"\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e[2022-11-03]\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e**\\nA sharp snap of wood made Fin twirl, knife at the ready.

He looked around in the darkness, just a sliver of light hanging above. He shifted around slightly, pieces of trash crumpling around him. He had slept in a trash bin again, he thought this alley was safe enough for the day. Maybe it wasn’t. He stared at the bin door above, had someone opened it? Was the sound he heard someone closing the heavy door again after discovering his hiding place? His heart started racing, if someone knew he was here that would mean trouble for him. He started, reaching for his pack buried in the corner, and sat up within the spacious bin, crouched, patting all of his pockets making sure he had everything he needed before he left.\\nPavel slowly pushed up the door just an inch to peer out into the light. For a few moments it was hard to see anything, the brightness was blinding. He blinked a few times before he was able to make out the scene in front of him. A dead man at the mouth to the alleyway lay pooled in his own blood, slumped against the wall. Pavel dropped the door immediately, sitting crouched in the darkness. Panic flooded his mind. Had anyone seen him? What if the killer is still here? Is he safe here?\\nAfter a deep breath Pavel fished around in his pack slowly for the little knife he had, resolute to make as little sound as possible. Finally finding the thing buried deep he pulled out the small blade, still sheathed in rough, scratchy leather. He never had to use this before. He hoped he still didn’t have to. He gripped the hilt and stripped the sheath off, his little dagger reflecting the small beam of light that filtered in through the seam in the door above him. Pavel was no brave warrior, he was a coward. He decided quickly waiting in his hiding place would be the best course of action. He didn’t know how active things were out there, the last thing he wanted was to get involved.\\nBut how long until someone discovers the body and investigators search the surrounding area? He cursed to himself, he was really stuck in an impossible situation wasn’t he? All he wanted to do was to disappear. He pushed his ear towards the thin opening, if someone was out there he wanted to know. Eventually a scream, he guessed someone finally found the body. Quietly cursing to himself he lifted the lid an inch to peek out again, barely seeing someone’s heel pass out of sight of the alley. They were going to notify the guards. Pavel swore and leaped out of the trash bin, stumbling on the landing. He just had to get out of here. Pavel had only taken a few steps forward before someone appeared near the entrance. They called out and pointed at him, “The killer is here!”\\nPavel realized he was still holding the knife in his hand, he swore loudly, looking about, begging to himself, “Please be a way out, please.” An unlabeled iron door stood sunken into the stone wall of the alley, one he hadn’t noticed last night on the way in. Without hesitation Pavel lunged for the handle and threw himself inside, still hearing the shouts behind him, the yells calling after him as the killer.\\n**\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n","Plain":"[2022-11-15]\\n** Pavel jolted awake, a loud sound ripped him from sleep.

He gripped the hilt and stripped the sheath off, his little dagger reflecting the small beam of light that filtered in through the seam in the door above him. Pavel was no brave warrior, he was a coward. He decided quickly waiting in his hiding place would be the best course of action. He didn’t know how active things were out there, the last thing he wanted was to get involved. But how long until someone discovers the body and investigators search the surrounding area? He cursed to himself, he was really stuck in an impossible situation wasn’t he? All he wanted to do was to disappear. He pushed his ear towards the thin opening, if someone was out there he wanted to know. Eventually a scream, he guessed someone finally found the body. Quietly cursing to himself he lifted the lid an inch to peek out again, barely seeing someone’s heel pass out of sight of the alley. They were going to notify the guards. Pavel swore and leaped out of the trash bin, stumbling on the landing. He just had to get out of here. Pavel had only taken a few steps forward before someone appeared near the entrance. They called out and pointed at him, “The killer is here!” Pavel realized he was still holding the knife in his hand, he swore loudly, looking about, begging to himself, “Please be a way out, please.” An unlabeled iron door stood sunken into the stone wall of the alley, one he hadn’t noticed last night on the way in. Without hesitation Pavel lunged for the handle and threw himself inside, still hearing the shouts behind him, the yells calling after him as the killer. **\\n","PlainWords":["[2022-11-15]","**","Pavel","jolted","awake,","a","loud","sound","ripped","him","from","sleep.","He","looked","around","in","the","darkness,","just","a","sliver","of","light","hanging","above.","He","shifted","around","slightly,","pieces","of","trash","crumpling","around","him.","He","had","slept","in","a","trash","bin","again,","he","thought","this","alley","was","safe","enough","for","the","day.","Maybe","it","wasn’t.","He","stared","at","the","bin","door","above,","had","someone","opened","it?","Was","the","sound","he","heard","someone","closing","the","heavy","door","again","after","discovering","his","hiding","place?","His","heart","started","racing,","if","someone","knew","he","was","here","that","would","mean","trouble","for","him.","He","started,","reaching","for","his","pack","buried","in","the","corner,","and","sat","up","within","the","spacious","bin,","crouched,","patting","all","of","his","pockets","making","sure","he","had","everything","he","needed","before","he","left.","Pavel","slowly","pushed","up","the","door","just","an","inch","to","peer","out","into","the","light.","For","a","few","moments","it","was","hard","to","see","anything,","the","brightness","was","blinding.","He","blinked","a","few","times","before","he","was","able","to","make","out","the","scene","in","front","of","him.","A","dead","man","at","the","mouth","to","the","alleyway","lay","pooled","in","his","own","blood,","slumped","against","the","wall.","Pavel","dropped","the","door","immediately,","sitting","crouched","in","the","darkness.","Panic","flooded","his","mind.","Had","anyone","seen","him?","What","if","the","killer","is","still","here?","Is","he","safe","here?","After","a","deep","breath","Pavel","fished","around","in","his","pack","slowly","for","the","little","knife","he","had,","resolute","to","make","as","little","sound","as","possible.","Finally","finding","the","thing","buried","deep","he","pulled","out","the","small","blade,","still","sheathed","in","rough,","scratchy","leather.","He","never","had","to","use","this","before.","He","hoped","he","still","didn’t","have","to.","He","gripped","the","hilt","and","stripped","the","sheath","off,","his","little","dagger","reflecting","the","small","beam","of","light","that","filtered","in","through","the","seam","in","the","door","above","him.","Pavel","was","no","brave","warrior,","he","was","a","coward.","He","decided","quickly","waiting","in","his","hiding","place","would","be","the","best","course","of","action.","He","didn’t","know","how","active","things","were","out","there,","the","last","thing","he","wanted","was","to","get","involved.","But","how","long","until","someone","discovers","the","body","and","investigators","search","the","surrounding","area?","He","cursed","to","himself,","he","was","really","stuck","in","an","impossible","situation","wasn’t","he?","All","he","wanted","to","do","was","to","disappear.","He","pushed","his","ear","towards","the","thin","opening,","if","someone","was","out","there","he","wanted","to","know.","Eventually","a","scream,","he","guessed","someone","finally","found","the","body.","Quietly","cursing","to","himself","he","lifted","the","lid","an","inch","to","peek","out","again,","barely","seeing","someone’s","heel","pass","out","of","sight","of","the","alley.","They","were","going","to","notify","the","guards.","Pavel","swore","and","leaped","out","of","the","trash","bin,","stumbling","on","the","landing.","He","just","had","to","get","out","of","here.","Pavel","had","only","taken","a","few","steps","forward","before","someone","appeared","near","the","entrance.","They","called","out","and","pointed","at","him,","“The","killer","is","here!”","Pavel","realized","he","was","still","holding","the","knife","in","his","hand,","he","swore","loudly,","looking","about,","begging","to","himself,","“Please","be","a","way","out,","please.”","An","unlabeled","iron","door","stood","sunken","into","the","stone","wall","of","the","alley,","one","he","hadn’t","noticed","last","night","on","the","way","in.","Without","hesitation","Pavel","lunged","for","the","handle","and","threw","himself","inside,","still","hearing","the","shouts","behind","him,","the","yells","calling","after","him","as","the","killer.","**"],"Summary":"[2022-11-15]\\n** Pavel jolted awake, a loud sound ripped him from sleep.

He looked around in the darkness, just a sliver of light hanging above. He shifted around slightly, pieces of trash crumpling around him. He had slept in a trash bin again, he thought this alley was safe enough for the day. Maybe it wasn’t. He stared at the bin door above, had someone opened it? Was the sound he heard someone closing the heavy door again after discovering his hiding place? His heart started racing, if someone knew he was here that would mean trouble for him. He started, reaching for his pack buried in the corner, and sat up within the spacious bin, crouched, patting all of his pockets making sure he had everything he needed before he left.\\nPavel slowly pushed up the door just an inch to peer out into the light. For a few moments it was hard to see anything, the brightness was blinding. He blinked a few times before he was able to make out the scene in front of him. A dead man at the mouth to the alleyway lay pooled in his own blood, slumped against the wall. Pavel dropped the door immediately, sitting crouched in the darkness. Panic flooded his mind.

He was tired, lost, and not in any position to continue as he had. Sleep. He needed it. Badly. How, though, could he now sleep knowing that there were people around?

He was tired, lost, and not in any position to continue as he had. Sleep. He needed it. Badly. How, though, could he now sleep knowing that there were people around? How could he sleep knowing this man specifically was around? The options were clear to Fin, before he could sleep he needed to make a choice.

The stranger still sat, warming the palms of his hands on the fire. He looked up at Fin with an almost humorous expression. “Sit down son, I’m too tired for that.” He shivered, “And cold.” He turned his expression away from Fin and back to the fire, enjoying its warmth. He had long messy and tangled brown hair and wore very simple garb, dark gray, almost robe-like. Strong features that looked so calm as he just stared content at the fire.\\n\\nWas this man here to hurt Fin? His immediate instincts said yes, but then they always said yes. “Who are you?” He blurted out, he gripped the handle a little tighter.\\n\\nThe stranger\'s eyes flicked back up to Fin, he looked almost surprised he was still holding him at knifepoint. “Friend, I’m someone who’s just a little chilled out here in the woods and could use a fire.” He raised his eyebrows, looking at his blade, “And someone who could use less of that.”\\n\\nDealing with people, especially strangers, wasn’t Fin’s speciality. He knew that. He always preferred the woods, the woods made sense. Animals made sense. Plants made sense. Everything was wired a certain way, he could figure it out, the way things worked out here, the food chain, the ecosystems. But people were another story, they were complex, they did things that didn’t make sense. Every person was so different, so hard to understand. They said things they didn’t mean, did things to cause pain. People hurt him. \\n\\nHis mind worked to assess this stranger, most immediate conclusions screamed this man was dangerous, that this man had been following him. He felt that nagging sensation though, the optimistic person within himself asking if he was really just threatening a man who came to him to share some heat and some safety from the environment. He did not lower the knife however. Not until he was decided. “What are you doing out here?”\\n\\n“I could ask you the same, friend. The grove here isn’t too keen on accepting travelers.” The strangers\' eyes looked around the both of them, from the canopy that sat above to the thick trunks of trees and brush that riddled the area. All gray and colorless. “The grove is a wondrous place, friend. But that doesn’t mean it’s welcoming.” His eyes returned to the fire. “Lord knows I clearly haven’t been shown any welcoming spirit.” He chuckled. \\n\\nFin swallowed, eyes still locked on the man before him. This stranger only gave him more questions, in both answers and directly. He looked at the knife in his hand. “I’m sorry about that.” Why did he apologize?\\n\\n“It’s okay, we all get jumpy out alone in the forests sometimes now don’t we?” The stranger said, he smiled at Fin despite the knife in his hand.\\n\\nFin didn’t have long until he would die, he didn’t know how long he had been awake either.

Wendel’s skin burned, the dry heat felt like it was searing him, a slow roast. As he walked he wondered how he would taste should he be prepared as a meal. If he was to die today anyway, which considering the scorching blaze the sun was throwing out, was indeed possible, would he be as delicious as a steak was? Could a chef work with what he had to offer? He raised up his hands, blistering in the heat, and took a look at himself. He wasn’t plump and he was sure his skin weighed more than his muscle did, he didn’t know much about butchery or animal breeders, but he knew the fat ones tasted the best, more value on those bones. Maybe he would taste like a cheap cut of meat, the ones only desperate and poor folk like himself would be willing to buy just to get even a taste of something special, something other than grain and mash. The kind that you weren’t sure if the cook just picked up off the road, some curious vermin who got a little too close to society’s bustle, a horse shoe imprint stuck in its coat. No, he wouldn’t taste that good he supposed. Not even in death could he be helpful to anyone. Not even for a meal.\\nHe lowered his head and trudged on, thoughts of food only served to torture him, even thoughts of himself as such. He didn’t know how long he had walked but he knew he had a ways ahead of him yet. He glanced up at the sky, the sun hanging there, bearing down misery upon him. He could use a hat though. That could at least make his face stop hurting, maybe take away a few of those bright sun spot afterimages that popped up every time he blinked. He tugged at his shirt a bit, could he reuse that into a hat? Was it stiff enough? He looked around himself, no trees but a few dead bushes, dry as the cracked and split ground were, sitting around doing nothing but dying. He ripped some fabric off his shirt and grabbed two twigs that he supposed were straight enough. He set the sticks to each side of his head and made them meet ahead of him, creating a triangle with his forehead, and used that as a guide to tie his makeshift hat in place. When he was done he had something that roughly resembled a hat, maybe if someone had made one that never had seen a hat and had only received descriptions from someone else who ALSO had never seen one you’d have something similar to what Wendel made. But it was enough of a hat to be called one and it worked passably for him, keeping the sun out of his eyes and off his nose and lips which were burnt by now, sensitive and stinging to touch.\\nAs he walked he considered the usefulness of his shirt as a hat against his own self as a meal. Both in death turned into something new, potentially beneficial for someone who could need it, but in the end he decided his shirt had fared better recycled. Though his shirt had won, he resolved himself into hoping he could become as useful as his hat had, just maybe without the dying part.\\n**\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n","Plain":"[2023-01-22]\\n** The sun was hot today.

He looked around himself, no trees but a few dead bushes, dry as the cracked and split ground were, sitting around doing nothing but dying. He ripped some fabric off his shirt and grabbed two twigs that he supposed were straight enough. He set the sticks to each side of his head and made them meet ahead of him, creating a triangle with his forehead, and used that as a guide to tie his makeshift hat in place. When he was done he had something that roughly resembled a hat, maybe if someone had made one that never had seen a hat and had only received descriptions from someone else who ALSO had never seen one you’d have something similar to what Wendel made. But it was enough of a hat to be called one and it worked passably for him, keeping the sun out of his eyes and off his nose and lips which were burnt by now, sensitive and stinging to touch. As he walked he considered the usefulness of his shirt as a hat against his own self as a meal. Both in death turned into something new, potentially beneficial for someone who could need it, but in the end he decided his shirt had fared better recycled. Though his shirt had won, he resolved himself into hoping he could become as useful as his hat had, just maybe without the dying part. **\\n","PlainWords":["[2023-01-22]","**","The","sun","was","hot","today.","Wendel’s","skin","burned,","the","dry","heat","felt","like","it","was","searing","him,","a","slow","roast.","As","he","walked","he","wondered","how","he","would","taste","should","he","be","prepared","as","a","meal.","If","he","was","to","die","today","anyway,","which","considering","the","scorching","blaze","the","sun","was","throwing","out,","was","indeed","possible,","would","he","be","as","delicious","as","a","steak","was?","Could","a","chef","work","with","what","he","had","to","offer?","He","raised","up","his","hands,","blistering","in","the","heat,","and","took","a","look","at","himself.","He","wasn’t","plump","and","he","was","sure","his","skin","weighed","more","than","his","muscle","did,","he","didn’t","know","much","about","butchery","or","animal","breeders,","but","he","knew","the","fat","ones","tasted","the","best,","more","value","on","those","bones.","Maybe","he","would","taste","like","a","cheap","cut","of","meat,","the","ones","only","desperate","and","poor","folk","like","himself","would","be","willing","to","buy","just","to","get","even","a","taste","of","something","special,","something","other","than","grain","and","mash.","The","kind","that","you","weren’t","sure","if","the","cook","just","picked","up","off","the","road,","some","curious","vermin","who","got","a","little","too","close","to","society’s","bustle,","a","horse","shoe","imprint","stuck","in","its","coat.","No,","he","wouldn’t","taste","that","good","he","supposed.","Not","even","in","death","could","he","be","helpful","to","anyone.","Not","even","for","a","meal.","He","lowered","his","head","and","trudged","on,","thoughts","of","food","only","served","to","torture","him,","even","thoughts","of","himself","as","such.","He","didn’t","know","how","long","he","had","walked","but","he","knew","he","had","a","ways","ahead","of","him","yet.","He","glanced","up","at","the","sky,","the","sun","hanging","there,","bearing","down","misery","upon","him.","He","could","use","a","hat","though.","That","could","at","least","make","his","face","stop","hurting,","maybe","take","away","a","few","of","those","bright","sun","spot","afterimages","that","popped","up","every","time","he","blinked.","He","tugged","at","his","shirt","a","bit,","could","he","reuse","that","into","a","hat?","Was","it","stiff","enough?","He","looked","around","himself,","no","trees","but","a","few","dead","bushes,","dry","as","the","cracked","and","split","ground","were,","sitting","around","doing","nothing","but","dying.","He","ripped","some","fabric","off","his","shirt","and","grabbed","two","twigs","that","he","supposed","were","straight","enough.","He","set","the","sticks","to","each","side","of","his","head","and","made","them","meet","ahead","of","him,","creating","a","triangle","with","his","forehead,","and","used","that","as","a","guide","to","tie","his","makeshift","hat","in","place.","When","he","was","done","he","had","something","that","roughly","resembled","a","hat,","maybe","if","someone","had","made","one","that","never","had","seen","a","hat","and","had","only","received","descriptions","from","someone","else","who","ALSO","had","never","seen","one","you’d","have","something","similar","to","what","Wendel","made.","But","it","was","enough","of","a","hat","to","be","called","one","and","it","worked","passably","for","him,","keeping","the","sun","out","of","his","eyes","and","off","his","nose","and","lips","which","were","burnt","by","now,","sensitive","and","stinging","to","touch.","As","he","walked","he","considered","the","usefulness","of","his","shirt","as","a","hat","against","his","own","self","as","a","meal.","Both","in","death","turned","into","something","new,","potentially","beneficial","for","someone","who","could","need","it,","but","in","the","end","he","decided","his","shirt","had","fared","better","recycled.","Though","his","shirt","had","won,","he","resolved","himself","into","hoping","he","could","become","as","useful","as","his","hat","had,","just","maybe","without","the","dying","part.","**"],"Summary":"[2023-01-22]\\n** The sun was hot today.

Wendel’s skin burned, the dry heat felt like it was searing him, a slow roast. As he walked he wondered how he would taste should he be prepared as a meal. If he was to die today anyway, which considering the scorching blaze the sun was throwing out, was indeed possible, would he be as delicious as a steak was? Could a chef work with what he had to offer? He raised up his hands, blistering in the heat, and took a look at himself. He wasn’t plump and he was sure his skin weighed more than his muscle did, he didn’t know much about butchery or animal breeders, but he knew the fat ones tasted the best, more value on those bones. Maybe he would taste like a cheap cut of meat, the ones only desperate and poor folk like himself would be willing to buy just to get even a taste of something special, something other than grain and mash. The kind that you weren’t sure if the cook just picked up off the road, some curious vermin who got a little too close to society’s bustle, a horse shoe imprint stuck in its coat. No, he wouldn’t taste that good he supposed. Not even in death could he be helpful to anyone. Not even for a meal. \\nHe lowered his head and trudged on, thoughts of food only served to torture him, even thoughts of himself as such. He didn’t know how long he had walked but he knew he had a ways ahead of him yet. He glanced up at the sky, the sun hanging there, bearing down misery upon him. He could use a hat though. That could at least make his face stop hurting, maybe take away a few of those bright sun spot afterimages that popped up every time he blinked. He tugged at his shirt a bit, could he reuse that into a hat? Was it stiff enough?

She heard a thump and winced and the sharp cry Pipe made. A part of her was glad to hear pain befall one of her slavers, that man and others had put her through worse, but a greater part of her was afraid. They were her last chance at getting home. \\n“If he moves, kick him again. See what’s inside the back.”\\nSeconds later a large blade hacked into the side of the wagon a few feet from where Cera sat, she barely suppressed a yelp. The wielder dislodged the weapon and rammed it down into the wood again, from her end it looked like the blade of a war axe. It was only a matter of time before they would be able to look into her cell here, she had to find a way to hide. She hesitantly scuttled towards the wall they were breaking open, hoping once they looked inward they wouldn’t look far enough in to see her in the corner, also hoping more men didn’t poke any extra holes in this side of the wagon, she was still wanting to remain in one piece. She closed her eyes for a moment, attempting to calm herself as the axe came down on the wood again and again, that terrible thwack, tearing open a hole in the wall. Once she heard the wood creak and rip she opened her eyes, blinding light poured into the dark little space, it was difficult to adjust to.\\nIt was immediately shadowed by a head looking into the new window. Cera pulled up her legs to her chest and tried to make herself as small as possible in the dark corner against the wall. \\n“Huh, fella was right. Empty.” A new voice this time. The light returned as he left. \\nCera let out a very quiet sigh of relief, she hadn’t even realized she was holding her breath.\\n“Then burn the wagon and kill him.

She was beginning to doubt the end of the story would offer any more useful explanations, just more vague metaphors.\\n\\n“Whatever.” Kedrel grumbled. “How much longer do we have to walk through this nightmare? Where are we going exactly?”\\n\\nRiv stopped abruptly, almost causing the other two to bump into him. “Here should probably do it actually, now that you mention it.” He said. Rallyn watched curiously as Riv waved the other two back a few steps and then lifted the large walking stick over his head and thrust it down into the earth. She wasn’t sure but Rallyn thought she saw the branch fade gray for a single moment as it struck. After releasing his grip on the wood it seemed to hold firm by itself, implanted within the ground a lot deeper than Rallyn would’ve thought. He pushed at it lightly to see if it would topple, seeming satisfied with its sturdiness he turned around to face the other two, his expression unreadable. “Let’s go.”\\n\\n“We came all this way for that?” Kedrel said. “That’s it?”\\n\\n“That’s it. I told Tem I didn’t need escorts.”\\n\\n“What is this for exactly?” Rallyn asked, studying the pole and squinting at it to see if the gray effect she had seen was in her head. *Could it have been light?*\\n\\n“It will serve as a reminder for the.. *person* who will find it. And yes. They will.” Riv said, starting to walk back in the direction they had come. “Let’s hurry, neither of you can be out past the Divide much longer, *especially now*.”\\n**","ResourceType":"page","MediaType":{"mainType":"application","subType":"octet-stream","delimiter":".","firstSuffix":{"suffix":"","fullSuffix":""},"type":"application/octet-stream","string":"application/octet-stream","suffixes":[""]},"Permalink":"https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/149/","RelPermalink":"/RaceLoreVault/notes/149/","Name":"","Title":"","Params":{"draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00"},"Data":{},"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Lastmod":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00","PublishDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","ExpiryDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Aliases":null,"BundleType":"","Description":"","Draft":false,"IsHome":false,"Keywords":null,"Kind":"page","Layout":"","LinkTitle":"","IsNode":false,"IsPage":true,"Path":"notes/149.md","Pathc":"notes/149.md","Slug":"","Lang":"en","IsSection":false,"Section":"notes","SectionsEntries":["notes"],"SectionsPath":"notes","Sitemap":{"ChangeFreq":"","Priority":-1,"Filename":"sitemap.xml"},"Type":"notes","Weight":0,"Language":{"Lang":"en","LanguageName":"","LanguageDirection":"","Title":"","Weight":0,"Disabled":false,"ContentDir":"","Cfg":{},"LocalCfg":{},"Provider":{}},"File":{"File":{}},"GitInfo":{"hash":"02b026b58e3a0302e0fa6c9a0a86c9220f7e57eb","abbreviatedHash":"02b026b5","subject":"Move notes to the correct location","authorName":"MarkTullius","authorEmail":"mark_tullius91@gmail.com","authorDate":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00","commitDate":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00"},"OutputFormats":[{"Rel":"canonical","Format":{"mediaType":"text/html","name":"HTML","path":"","baseName":"index","rel":"canonical","protocol":"","isPlainText":false,"isHTML":true,"noUgly":false,"notAlternative":false,"permalinkable":true,"weight":10}}],"AlternativeOutputFormats":null,"Menus":null,"TranslationKey":"page/notes/149","IsTranslated":false,"AllTranslations":null,"Translations":null,"GetIdentity":{"Type":"content","Path":"notes/149.md"}},{"Content":"\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e[2021-06-04]\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e**\\nThe Universal Court had decided, and that was that.

A liberated part of the world which held no direct contempt for him anymore. His new life was strange by all measures, but it felt right. He was somebody now. He made changes in the world. He was *important.*\\nHe prowled through the darkness, his little notebook held out in front of him. Light behaved differently here, so when the red ink on the top of the page glowed, it instead grayed itself out. It was light enough to see compared to the thick shadow around it, but still dull compared to what it would look like on the other side, a gleaming crimson. \\nA gray line was forming from the bottom of the page as he walked, inking itself upward towards the dot. An interactive map of sorts. Interesting that the dot at the top did not turn into a line itself, moving around the page. He was hunting a person, not a place. What would a pulser be doing past the Divide this long?\\n“Hey, next time how about we do this on a real map, you know, with pictures?”\\nThe word *‘Ungrateful’* slowly formed on the other open page. \\n“I’m sorry, I didn’t realize *I* was the one being ungrateful, when’s the last time *I* heard a ‘thank you Perin’?”\\nNo words formed. Perin smiled. It was amazing how easy it was to get under the skin of a god. How human they felt. \\n“It’s okay, I forgive you, I’m sure you’re just nervous to be around someone so divine.” Perin said. “Maybe draw some symbols next time, you know, for scale. With how long I’ve been walking you’d think I’d be going to Elrin.”\\n*’Limited.’*\\nPerin hummed as a response. The god’s limitations were profound, hence the need for Perin’s *involvement*, but it was still baffling to him. Every action the god did or didn’t take only made Perin’s mental image of that limiting line blurrier. Sometimes he was sure the god preferred it that way. \\n“It’s okay, I knew a lad who was limited, he drew pictures just fine. Maybe that’s the key to artistry my friend, just stand behind a horse like he did.”\\n**","ResourceType":"page","MediaType":{"mainType":"application","subType":"octet-stream","delimiter":".","firstSuffix":{"suffix":"","fullSuffix":""},"type":"application/octet-stream","string":"application/octet-stream","suffixes":[""]},"Permalink":"https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/151/","RelPermalink":"/RaceLoreVault/notes/151/","Name":"","Title":"","Params":{"draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00"},"Data":{},"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Lastmod":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00","PublishDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","ExpiryDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Aliases":null,"BundleType":"","Description":"","Draft":false,"IsHome":false,"Keywords":null,"Kind":"page","Layout":"","LinkTitle":"","IsNode":false,"IsPage":true,"Path":"notes/151.md","Pathc":"notes/151.md","Slug":"","Lang":"en","IsSection":false,"Section":"notes","SectionsEntries":["notes"],"SectionsPath":"notes","Sitemap":{"ChangeFreq":"","Priority":-1,"Filename":"sitemap.xml"},"Type":"notes","Weight":0,"Language":{"Lang":"en","LanguageName":"","LanguageDirection":"","Title":"","Weight":0,"Disabled":false,"ContentDir":"","Cfg":{},"LocalCfg":{},"Provider":{}},"File":{"File":{}},"GitInfo":{"hash":"02b026b58e3a0302e0fa6c9a0a86c9220f7e57eb","abbreviatedHash":"02b026b5","subject":"Move notes to the correct location","authorName":"MarkTullius","authorEmail":"mark_tullius91@gmail.com","authorDate":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00","commitDate":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00"},"OutputFormats":[{"Rel":"canonical","Format":{"mediaType":"text/html","name":"HTML","path":"","baseName":"index","rel":"canonical","protocol":"","isPlainText":false,"isHTML":true,"noUgly":false,"notAlternative":false,"permalinkable":true,"weight":10}}],"AlternativeOutputFormats":null,"Menus":null,"TranslationKey":"page/notes/151","IsTranslated":false,"AllTranslations":null,"Translations":null,"GetIdentity":{"Type":"content","Path":"notes/151.md"}},{"Content":"\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e[2023-04-27]\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e**\\nRyn spent the next hour or so treading carefully towards the distant light, keeping low.

Felt like an inevitability.”\\n\\n“Why sign yourself up for the fleets then?” Zarin asked. “You got out, you’re just running back into the same system, kid.”\\n\\nAarand spent a moment in contemplation. “I wanted to change things. Didn’t want to sit by and watch anymore.”\\n\\nZarin sighed, well that’s fucking disappointing. Another bright eyed kid who thought they had the potential and desire to change the universe for the better. This was the wrong place to sign up for that. But Minerva, *that* was interesting. A sector that broke free. Unconquered. \\n\\n“I want a comprehensive report sent through your station officer about Minerva.” Zarin said sharply, he could see Aarand stand up straighter at his sudden change of tone. “We don’t receive many reports or messages from the outer sectors, especially not Minerva. I want to know what factors led to its collapse and a list of the major players and factions fighting for control. Estimates for each on firepower, fleet statuses, and manpower.”\\n\\nAarand bowed quickly. “I’ll do my best, anything else captain?” \\n\\n“No,” Zarin said, waving over Aarand’s supervising officer. “and learn to salute. You’re a part of the Empyrean crew now, time to act like it.” \\n**","ResourceType":"page","MediaType":{"mainType":"application","subType":"octet-stream","delimiter":".","firstSuffix":{"suffix":"","fullSuffix":""},"type":"application/octet-stream","string":"application/octet-stream","suffixes":[""]},"Permalink":"https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/155/","RelPermalink":"/RaceLoreVault/notes/155/","Name":"","Title":"","Params":{"draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00"},"Data":{},"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Lastmod":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00","PublishDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","ExpiryDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Aliases":null,"BundleType":"","Description":"","Draft":false,"IsHome":false,"Keywords":null,"Kind":"page","Layout":"","LinkTitle":"","IsNode":false,"IsPage":true,"Path":"notes/155.md","Pathc":"notes/155.md","Slug":"","Lang":"en","IsSection":false,"Section":"notes","SectionsEntries":["notes"],"SectionsPath":"notes","Sitemap":{"ChangeFreq":"","Priority":-1,"Filename":"sitemap.xml"},"Type":"notes","Weight":0,"Language":{"Lang":"en","LanguageName":"","LanguageDirection":"","Title":"","Weight":0,"Disabled":false,"ContentDir":"","Cfg":{},"LocalCfg":{},"Provider":{}},"File":{"File":{}},"GitInfo":{"hash":"02b026b58e3a0302e0fa6c9a0a86c9220f7e57eb","abbreviatedHash":"02b026b5","subject":"Move notes to the correct location","authorName":"MarkTullius","authorEmail":"mark_tullius91@gmail.com","authorDate":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00","commitDate":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00"},"OutputFormats":[{"Rel":"canonical","Format":{"mediaType":"text/html","name":"HTML","path":"","baseName":"index","rel":"canonical","protocol":"","isPlainText":false,"isHTML":true,"noUgly":false,"notAlternative":false,"permalinkable":true,"weight":10}}],"AlternativeOutputFormats":null,"Menus":null,"TranslationKey":"page/notes/155","IsTranslated":false,"AllTranslations":null,"Translations":null,"GetIdentity":{"Type":"content","Path":"notes/155.md"}},{"Content":"\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e[2023-05-31]\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e**\\nAarand followed in line behind his escort officer down the halls of the Empyrean.

He had gone down to the cafeteria to scout his new home of LQ-H a bit more. The orange halls were surprisingly easy to navigate, everything was labeled well, the flow was controlled, it made sense. He didn’t interact with any of the other residents but had again received a lot of stares and questioning looks at his blue jumpsuit. He didn’t have to push through any crowds of people but there were definitely jumpsuited men and women everywhere he looked, typical numbers of what he’d see down on the streets of Windfall. Something he had remembered one of the officers saying was that it was indeed rare for recruits to be inducted into the Empyrean at these cycles, it was undoubtedly drawing some unwanted attention. Hopefully his cover story could hold. Overall he had made it back to his room without incident. At least he hoped so. \\n\\nHe sat down in front of his own personal panel, taking a bite out of the wrap.

They say when your world is crumbling around you your mind can start to race and blur, an overwhelming amount of thoughts drowning your ability to reason.

It was time.\\nThe guard unlocked the cell and stood in the doorway eyeing his prisoner.\\nMirh slowly looked into the guardsman’s eyes, at first it seemed pleading but it was clear it was acknowledgement, a tired sense of overwhelming guilt. Mirh understood.\\nHe was led down a dark corridor for what seemed like an eternity. He could hear the uproar of the crowd as they anticipated the event, the screaming joy and excitement. Finally they reached the end, a small wooden door was now the last barrier between life and death. Mirh smiled.\\nThe light was blinding, the explosion of sound was deafening. Mirh recoiled, his senses desperately trying to make sense of his surroundings.

Pavel fumbled with a match trying his best to light it, the humidity stopping him. The air was so damp he felt almost underwater. He pocketed the matches and resorted to feeling around with his hands. He ran his fingertips over several items and papers on the shelf in front of him, nothing texturally stood out to him. Metal is what he was looking for, gold or silver specifically, anything he could fence or pawn. Feeling the smooth cold surface of a trinket he stopped, bringing it as close to his face as he could he tried to see what it was. Useless. He stowed it away in his front pocket. Treasure hunting wasn’t as glamorous and fulfilling as the tales say. The only difference between a treasure hunter and a thief in most peoples’ eyes was if the owner of the treasure was alive or not and for how long. Pavel’s definition was more blurred these days.

creating enough illuminated space for his scrawling on the stacked pages in front of him. It was too late to still suffer through such things, why had he been cursed with such responsibilities as these? And yet he wrote with earnestness despite his predicament for he was one of few who could write such texts, one of the few with the familiarity of these ideas. Had the gods damned him with such knowledge? What blessing created such debilitating fatigue? An overworked field hand would feel more mental stability, a higher sense of peace of mind he assured himself.\\nOf course Barnib never so much as held a farming tool in his smooth uncalloused hands, but the weight of this pressure was extreme and it made him feel validated to assume he had been worked harder. It gave him rightful cause to the way he was feeling. \\nOh such pressure! Such overwhelming pressure.. and he spent his time ruminating over this situation instead of focusing on his works. He needed to focus. His hand wasn’t moving, it wasn’t writing. Why couldn’t he write anymore? Why couldn’t he spill out words into the page like before? Was this his limit? Would his downfall be a mental block? He threw the pen away in frustration, in the cramped space it ended up moving only to the other side of the littered desk. He held his face in his hands not caring the ink residue was staining his cheeks. What would become of him in the days that followed? He would exist only as a failure through text and tongue. \\nHe sat for a moment, his mind silent, his burst of emotion subsided, he lowered his hands from his face to see he had toppled over a jar of ink onto his works he was writing, the heavy ink already seeping through the thick paged book. \\nThere was a moment of panic but he felt frozen and helpless throughout it. Why couldn’t he move? He sat and watched the ink soak deeper into the parchment, words being submerged and lost. In that moment he convinced himself this is what he deserved after all. With mere hours left the only hope that was left died in the blacked out pages of that book. \\nThe soft light from the few too little candles he had danced across his little cubby, he noticed it now, not entranced by his works any longer. He stared at how the flames licked and played at the wicks of the small candles, such power within flame, yet given so little room to utilize its potential. \\nWhat a fool he was, locked in this little room. What prodigies and prophetic skill has he squandered in such places? He could’ve been something. Now no longer. His chances gone like the passages beneath him, drowned by their own essence.\\nHe was never a particularly religious individual but he knew of the Gods in theory. He had translated many works detailing the histories, the theocracies, the words that the Gods themselves had spoken into being throughout humankind. Supposedly.\\nNevertheless he put his skeptical mind aside, tucking his hands under his shoulders. He felt uncomfortable but he knew it was the common prayer position, it symbolized death, for what are we to the Gods but nothing? They are the ones who grant life.**","ResourceType":"page","MediaType":{"mainType":"application","subType":"octet-stream","delimiter":".","firstSuffix":{"suffix":"","fullSuffix":""},"type":"application/octet-stream","string":"application/octet-stream","suffixes":[""]},"Permalink":"https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/76/","RelPermalink":"/RaceLoreVault/notes/76/","Name":"","Title":"","Params":{"draft":false,"iscjklanguage":false,"lastmod":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00"},"Data":{},"Date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Lastmod":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00","PublishDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","ExpiryDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Aliases":null,"BundleType":"","Description":"","Draft":false,"IsHome":false,"Keywords":null,"Kind":"page","Layout":"","LinkTitle":"","IsNode":false,"IsPage":true,"Path":"notes/76.md","Pathc":"notes/76.md","Slug":"","Lang":"en","IsSection":false,"Section":"notes","SectionsEntries":["notes"],"SectionsPath":"notes","Sitemap":{"ChangeFreq":"","Priority":-1,"Filename":"sitemap.xml"},"Type":"notes","Weight":0,"Language":{"Lang":"en","LanguageName":"","LanguageDirection":"","Title":"","Weight":0,"Disabled":false,"ContentDir":"","Cfg":{},"LocalCfg":{},"Provider":{}},"File":{"File":{}},"GitInfo":{"hash":"02b026b58e3a0302e0fa6c9a0a86c9220f7e57eb","abbreviatedHash":"02b026b5","subject":"Move notes to the correct location","authorName":"MarkTullius","authorEmail":"mark_tullius91@gmail.com","authorDate":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00","commitDate":"2023-06-06T23:07:09+01:00"},"OutputFormats":[{"Rel":"canonical","Format":{"mediaType":"text/html","name":"HTML","path":"","baseName":"index","rel":"canonical","protocol":"","isPlainText":false,"isHTML":true,"noUgly":false,"notAlternative":false,"permalinkable":true,"weight":10}}],"AlternativeOutputFormats":null,"Menus":null,"TranslationKey":"page/notes/76","IsTranslated":false,"AllTranslations":null,"Translations":null,"GetIdentity":{"Type":"content","Path":"notes/76.md"}},{"Content":"\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e[2022-04-22]\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e**He reached out, honestly, begging for someone to heed his calls.

He was crying, his chest heaving. How could he have done what he just did? He knew why, he knew after tasting that water he had to. One of them had to live. He fell to his knees, begging. “Please, the water. Don’t let this be in vain.” “Hmm, the fates have denied you.”

Hey listen, do this for me and I’ll roll the fates for water. Seems you’re pretty thirsty there soldier.”\\nJov was the God of luck and misfortune, the God of Chance. A terrible malicious deity Linim had decided some time ago. He would ask Linim to do things for him, smaller things usually, and roll the fates either bringing happiness or despair. Greed at first allowed him to play into it, and for a while he seemed to be winning against the fates, he felt his luck overpowered even their own. But arrogance had since led him here, to be humbled by the hands of the fates themselves. So he cursed them with every step.\\nJov had offered him a chance at survival, water, should he kill a man. No. Of course he wouldn’t. But.. he might have to. The question rose again, how much time did he have left out here in the scorching plains? Would he be willing to die to let another man live? But how long did this other man have left to live? Would it not be better for at least one of them to escape alive? \\nLinim gritted his teeth, he hated even considering such madness. But one thing was for certain, he didn’t want to die out here.\\nHe grabbed the hilt of his sword.\\nAlmost as if a sense of knowing passed over the man in front of Linim, the man started to speak. “I hope you hold in there Lin, maybe when we reach the other side we can get you some help ya know?” The man’s name was Ganren, he spoke with a soft but caring voice. He had always treated Linim with kindness and respect. “Gods, maybe I can see my kids again.” He chuckled, turning his head to Linim behind him. “Have any family Lin?”\\nLinim swallowed. His firm grip not releasing off of the sword. “No.” He barely stumbled out the word. \\n“Ah shame.” Ganren turned back forward, “They really do make this whole thing worth it ya know?” \\n“Kill him.”\\n“My wife always said that I was stubborn, heh, look at me out here.”\\n“Kill him.”\\n“Hey Lin, you still need water?”\\n“KILL HIM!” \\nLinim raised a hopeful eyebrow, “Yeah.” He could feel the dryness in his throat as he spoke. “Do you have any to spare?” \\nGanren raised his pouch, shaking it a bit. “Aw nothing but a drop or two I imagine. But here.” Ganren lifted the strap over his head and handed the waterskin to Linim. “I’m sure you need it more than me brother. Stay in there.” Without waiting for thanks, Ganren looked forward again towards the horizon. \\nLinim took the pouch in his hand, mind swimming. Dazed. Jov was quiet. Linim scrambled and popped the top pushing the pouch to his lips, feeling a sip of water rejuvenate his mouth, his throat. Ganren was right, only a bit remained. As quickly as it had come, it was gone. It may not have helped as much as he had hoped, but it gave him life for that moment.\\nLinim looked towards the horizon, the flat heat warped plains of oblivion. “Thank you Gen.” And with that he rammed the blade of his sword through the back of the man’s chest. \\nThe others in front stopped and watched in horror as Linim ripped the steel blade from his friend’s back, letting him fall to the cracked earth, dead. \\n“Now give me water!” Linim was shouting at the tormenting God now.

Riv moved himself over along the bench he sat and motioned to the space to sit, “Please, if you’re gonna eat like that.”\\nThe hungry man stared at Riv for a moment like a caught rat, contemplating something. Maybe no one had shown this man any kindness for a while. He sat down hesitantly, continuing to eat the bread, only slowing down enough to get seated properly. He glanced back at Riv occasionally while he ate and dug more pieces of bread out of the basket. There wasn’t much space between them on the large bar seat, close enough that he could smell the grime off of the man’s clothes. Riv grimaced but remained where he was. “What’s your name stranger?” Riv had to speak loudly over the noise of the room.\\nTaking a moment to swallow the last piece the man turned and reached out a dirt stained hand, the tips of fingernails dark with filth. “The name’s Pavel.”\\nRiv was happy for once that he was wearing gloves. Before Riv could shake the man’s hand Pavel instead pointed at Riv’s drink, “You mind?” He cleared his throat, his shallow attempt at showing how parched he was.\\n“Uh, go for it kid.” Riv slid the drink over to him. It only took a few seconds for Pavel to gulp the whole thing down. “So, whe-”\\nBefore Riv could finish asking anything Pavel stood up and patted his coat, a smile across his face. “Thank you for the meal sir but I best be on my way.” He turned to leave but stood a moment, the crowd shifting in front of him.

celebration of some sort. Riv sat off to the side and watched. With rural cities like this the festivities usually seemed so meaningless to him, what new field had they bore fruit from this season? He really didn’t care. Back home in Tivin he could remember his father taking him and his family to a feast after their King had conquered the neighboring province, he remembered the bonfires and how they welcomed the soldiers back home victorious. That’s what celebration looked like. \\nHe took another sip of his drink as he watched a man spin and fall to the ground after trying to impress a barmaid. These people were content with their little lives at least, for now. He liked Wintrel though, the people here were simple and the nation was generally free of conflict. The layout of the kingdom’s city was fortified and powerful, despite their weakness as a nation he knew the strategic defense they had repelled attackers thus far. He might stay a little longer, he needed a break. He absently broke off another piece of stale bread to chew on. For a nation that grew wheat it was pathetic for this tavern to serve anything besides the freshest of fare, he dropped the bread back in the small basket and pushed it away from him. He would have to find another place to set up and drink. \\nA small man weaseled his way through the crowd and entered in Riv’s little nook where he sat. The man was clearly poor, his ragged clothing and unwashed face and hair stood out even in the dim smothered light of the pub. “Are you done with that bread sir?” He had his hands behind his back in a very servantly posture. \\nThis man clearly didn’t work here and was apparently resigning himself to taking unwanted food from others instead of paying. Riv leaned forward and pushed the bread basket towards him without a word. With no hesitation the man dove into the basket and shoved the stale bread in his mouth, chewing and swallowing chunks with barely a breath in between. This man was starved. Riv moved himself over along the bench he sat and motioned to the space to sit, “Please, if you’re gonna eat like that.”\\nThe hungry man stared at Riv for a moment like a caught rat, contemplating something. Maybe no one had shown this man any kindness for a while. He sat down hesitantly, continuing to eat the bread, only slowing down enough to get seated properly. He glanced back at Riv occasionally while he ate and dug more pieces of bread out of the basket. There wasn’t much space between them on the large bar seat, close enough that he could smell the grime off of the man’s clothes. Riv grimaced but remained where he was. “What’s your name stranger?” Riv had to speak loudly over the noise of the room.\\nTaking a moment to swallow the last piece the man turned and reached out a dirt stained hand, the tips of fingernails dark with filth. “The name’s Pavel.”\\nRiv was happy for once that he was wearing gloves. Before Riv could shake the man’s hand Pavel instead pointed at Riv’s drink, “You mind?” He cleared his throat, his shallow attempt at showing how parched he was. \\n“Uh, go for it kid.” Riv slid the drink over to him. It only took a few seconds for Pavel to gulp the whole thing down. “So, whe-”\\nBefore Riv could finish asking anything Pavel stood up and patted his coat, a smile across his face. “Thank you for the meal sir but I best be on my way.” He turned to leave but stood a moment, the crowd shifting in front of him.

Would the assassin be here tonight? Tomorrow? She rubbed her gloved hands together, fighting off the piercing chill. Tonight King Tem had ordered a feast in the castle knowing an assassin was lurking about in wait. Rallyn thought it was a bait of some sort by the old king, he was admittedly crafty. Must have had some tricks up his sleeve to have survived this long on that throne after all.\\nWhatever his plan was, Rallyn’s plan was to stand here safely. She knew the truth about herself, she was afraid. She didn’t want to find an unnamed murderer that was bold enough to threaten a monarch, she wanted to live another day. She found she was starting to ask herself the tough questions.\\n\\u003cem\\u003eIf I saw the killer would I even do anything to stop him? *\\nShe sighed, pretty sure she knew the answer.

A long banquet table piled with a vast assortment of trays and plates of the province’s finest food and drink filled the hall. Servants passing through doorways set into the long side of the room were taking empty plates and replacing them with full ones, extravagant meals piled high. A seemingly endless array to choose from, breathtaking. The hall itself wasn’t the grandest but it bore subtleties of luxury, the colored tapestries made of fine silks, the table itself was Gnawood, even the plates were shaped and polished from silvear bones.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eRiv poked at a baked pheasant with his fork idly as he watched the flow of the room, working like a well oiled machine. Even the fork was intricately cut silvear bone, he twirled it in his fingers and went for another bite. The bird was delicious by way of standards of course but it was coated in rich sauces and spices that he couldn’t quite stomach, he tried washing away the taste with a few sips of ale. He moved that plate aside and opted for one with a colorful looking bread. A servant swept up his discarded dish only moments after pushing it away.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHe could hear the king talking across the table a few seats over to a group of what looked like merchant leaders. The tradesmasters always donned those bright colored vests and chains, some fashion he didn’t understand. Why make things complicated? He could hear mentions of trade routes to Paranel but he didn’t care enough to hold focus to it. That’s not why he was here. He would wait.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHe tore a piece off the loaf, inspecting the colors that swirled through the middle of the bread, red and brown. Sweet looking spice dusted the top of the bread, a pleasant looking roll. \\u003cem\\u003eWhere were breads like this in the rest of Wintrel?\\u003c/em\\u003e The kingdom, for all of its farming aptitude, still produced mediocre food in the local taverns. But this roll screamed decadence.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e“Lord Rivinwell, I hope you know the food isn’t poisoned.”\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eRiv looked up to see the king himself had moved directly across from him, watching him inspect the bread with a smile. “Please.” He lowered the bread back to the plate. “Riv.”\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e“Very well. Riv.” The king said, nodding at his request. “I too am much fonder of the shortened names these days, Temerel is such a bother to say.” He smiled again. “I appreciate your presence at tonight’s feast.”\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e“Don’t appreciate it too much, I haven’t yet told you why I’m actually here.

Her daughter, you see, had made friends with the little prince, a devious and malicious little boy. He locked her in a dungeon room and had thrown away the key. When our smith got to the keep she found what she had feared most, that the message was true. Her precious daughter locked away behind a mountain of steel, one as fate would have it, that she herself had forged.” Riv pointed at the king with a tear of bread in his hand, “I know you aren’t a father Tem, but surely you understand that no storm could come between you and your own child.”\\n\\n    Tem nodded, “Of course.”\\n\\n    “And in our story so did the king, protecting his son.” \\n    \\n    The king for the first time dropped his smile and frowned in understanding frustration.  \\n\\n    “The king forbade anyone from interfering with the cell except the blacksmith herself. He didn’t want it getting out that his son, heir to the throne, was a little demon. He couldn’t usurp him before he had even hit manhood. So our smith worked to save her own. She used hammers, axes, swords, bent-steel rods all to no avail. Her craftsmanship of a dungeon chamber was simply too fine. There was one flaw in her design though, the lock on the door itself, the only piece she didn’t make. She was no locksmith, so she had to use caution. If she were to break and jam the lock her child would die in that room, dungeon cell sealed forever. The smith started work on lockpicks but this was one area she had never delved into with her profession. She created works on a large scale, built to destroy, made to last, not flimsy picks. And flimsy they were, they all broke upon entering the keyhole. This was a powerful lock my friend, one imbued with magin. Simple steel was destroyed, the key must have been made from a powerful alloy.” \\n    \\n    Riv waved down a passing servant and pointed at the bit of remaining bread he had left, and nodded with a smile.

Though out here it was hard to tell. No scavengers had gotten to it yet which was a surprise. He glanced back at the two guardsmen that accompanied him in the darkness. The king had thought it was wise to not have their only Pulser in the kingdom sent out alone past the Divide without backup. For all that the king was intelligent, he was also ignorant. How much did the man really know about Riv’s people? He squinted through the shadows around himself, he felt almost blind and incapacitated in the low light level. This would definitely take some getting used to after living with light for so long.\\n\\nOut here past the Divide everything was dark, an eternal umbra an unchanging level of dusk that remained throughout the days and nights. Looking up into the sky you could make out the dim gray disks of the sun and moons. Life here didn’t exist the same way it did on the other side. The darkness seemed to permeate through everything, the flora grew in sickly desperate strains, no real light to feed it properly. The animals who survived off the unsubstantial flora grew equally as twisted and diseased, the effect winding up the food chain.\\n\\nThough their group had only traveled a half hour through the darkness it seemed like another world entirely, even a few steps past the Divide would grant the same effect. Riv could see the expressions of the two people with him barely through the thick shade. They clearly had never set foot on this side had they? The taller guardsman, Kedrel, who wore the silvery steel plate seemed to grip his heavy blade like someone would take it from him. He would jump at his own shadow if there were any in the darkness.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you\\u0026rsquo;d like to get.\\nThe majority of configuration can be found under data/config.yaml.

The default without any set favicon key is:\\n15  \\u0026lt;link rel=\\u0026#34;shortcut icon\\u0026#34; href=\\u0026#34;icon.png\\u0026#34; type=\\u0026#34;image/png\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;   The default can be overridden by defining a value to the favicon key in your data/config.yaml file. For example, here is a List[Dictionary] example format, which is equivalent to the default:\\nfavicon:- {rel:\\u0026#34;shortcut icon\\u0026#34;, href:\\u0026#34;icon.png\\u0026#34;, type:\\u0026#34;image/png\\u0026#34;}# - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to addIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it may be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the Apple touch icon to Quartz\\u0026rsquo;s default favicon:\\nfavicon:|\\u0026lt;link rel=\\u0026#34;shortcut icon\\u0026#34; href=\\u0026#34;icon.png\\u0026#34; type=\\u0026#34;image/png\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;link rel=\\u0026#34;apple-touch-icon\\u0026#34; sizes=\\u0026#34;180x180\\u0026#34; href=\\u0026#34;/apple-touch-icon.png\\u0026#34;\\u0026gt;This second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your webpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more information about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read this article.\\nNote that all generated favicon paths, defined by the href attribute, are relative to the static/ directory.\\nGraph View To customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around data/graphConfig.yaml.\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45  # if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usualenableGlobalGraph:false### Local Graph ###localGraph:# whether automatically generate a legendenableLegend:false# whether to allow dragging nodes in the graphenableDrag:true# whether to allow zooming and panning the graphenableZoom:true# how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)depth:1# initial zoom factor of the graphscale:1.2# how strongly nodes should repel each otherrepelForce:2# how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravitycenterForce:1# what the default link length should belinkDistance:1# how big the node labels should befontSize:0.6# scale at which to start fading the labes on nodesopacityScale:3### Global Graph ###globalGraph:# same settings as above### For all graphs #### colour specific nodes path off of their pathpaths:- /moc:\\u0026#34;#4388cc\\u0026#34;  Styling Want to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing assets/styles/custom.scss. If you\\u0026rsquo;d like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in /layouts/partials.\\nPartials Partials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in /layouts.\\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through /layouts/index.html. To customize the footer, you can edit /layouts/partials/footer.html\\nMore info about partials on Hugo\\u0026rsquo;s website.\\nStill having problems?

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz\'s configuration:\\n\\n    ```yaml {title=\\"data/config.yaml\\", linenos=false}\\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\\n    ```\\n\\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\\n\\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\\n       ```yaml {title=\\"data/config.yaml\\"}\\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\\n       ```\\n      ```\\n\\n**Note** that if `{title=\\u003cmy-title\\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\\n\\n### HTML Favicons\\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \\ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \\n`favicon` key is:\\n\\n```html {title=\\"layouts/partials/head.html\\", linenostart=15}\\n\\u003clink rel=\\"shortcut icon\\" href=\\"icon.png\\" type=\\"image/png\\"\\u003e\\n```\\n\\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \\n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\\nequivalent to the default:\\n\\n```yaml {title=\\"data/config.yaml\\", linenos=false}\\nfavicon:\\n  - { rel: \\"shortcut icon\\", href: \\"icon.png\\", type: \\"image/png\\" }\\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\\n```\\n\\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\\n\\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \\n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz\'s default favicon:\\n\\n```yaml {title=\\"data/config.yaml\\", linenos=false}\\nfavicon: |\\n  \\u003clink rel=\\"shortcut icon\\" href=\\"icon.png\\" type=\\"image/png\\"\\u003e\\n  \\u003clink rel=\\"apple-touch-icon\\" sizes=\\"180x180\\" href=\\"/apple-touch-icon.png\\"\\u003e\\n```\\n\\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \\nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \\ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \\n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\\n\\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \\nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\\n\\n### Graph View\\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\\n\\n```yaml {title=\\"data/graphConfig.yaml\\"}\\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\\nenableGlobalGraph: false\\n\\n### Local Graph ###\\nlocalGraph:\\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\\n    enableLegend: false\\n    \\n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\\n    enableDrag: true\\n    \\n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\\n    enableZoom: true\\n    \\n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\\n    depth: 1\\n    \\n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\\n    scale: 1.2\\n    \\n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\\n    repelForce: 2\\n\\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\\n    centerForce: 1\\n\\n    # what the default link length should be\\n    linkDistance: 1\\n    \\n    # how big the node labels should be\\n    fontSize: 0.6\\n    \\n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\\n    opacityScale: 3\\n\\n### Global Graph ###\\nglobalGraph:\\n\\t# same settings as above\\n\\n### For all graphs ###\\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\\npaths:\\n  - /moc: \\"#4388cc\\"\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Styling\\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you\'d like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \\n\\n### Partials\\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\\n\\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\\n\\nMore info about partials on [Hugo\'s website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\\n\\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\\n\\n## Language Support\\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\\n\\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)?

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\\nEnable GitHub Actions Permissions By default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!).

Enable GitHub Pages\\nPushing Changes To see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\\n\\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\\n\\nHead to `Settings \\u003e Action \\u003e General \\u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\\n\\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\\n\\n### Enable GitHub Pages\\n\\nHead to the \'Settings\' tab of your forked repository and go to the \'Pages\' tab.\\n\\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\\n\\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\\n\\n### Pushing Changes\\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\\n\\n```shell\\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\\ncd \\u003cpath-to-quartz\\u003e\\n\\n# Commit all changes\\ngit add .\\ngit commit -m \\"message describing changes\\"\\n\\n# Push to GitHub to update site\\ngit push origin hugo\\n```\\n\\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\\n\\n### Setting up the Site\\nNow let\'s get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That\'s easy too.\\n\\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub\'s free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \\n\\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\\n\\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\\n\\n```toml\\nbaseURL = \\"https://\\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\\u003e/\\"\\n```\\n\\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\\n\\n```toml\\nbaseURL = \\"https://\\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\\u003e.github.io/quartz/\\"\\n```\\n\\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don\'t have a custom domain to use, you can use `\\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\\u003e.github.io`.\\n\\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\\n\\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\\n\\n```yaml {title=\\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\\"}\\n- name: Deploy  \\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \\n  with:  \\n\\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\\n\\tpublish_dir: ./public  \\n\\tpublish_branch: master\\n\\tcname: \\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\\u003e\\n```\\n\\nHave a custom domain?

Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\\n4.

There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\\nMy GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz Make sure you set the source to deploy from master (and not hugo) using / (root)! See more in the hosting guide\\nSome of my pages have \\u0026lsquo;January 1, 0001\\u0026rsquo; as the last modified date This is a problem caused by git treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names.

Quartz by default uses Plausible for analytics.\\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this guide in the Hugo documentation.\\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by following this guide.\\nHow do I change the content on the home page? To edit the main home page, open /content/_index.md.\\nHow do I change the colours? You can change the theme by editing assets/custom.scss. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the customization guide.\\nHow do I add images?
