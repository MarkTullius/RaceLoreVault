among the stars humanity had spread out to claim new homes. a region of the galaxy known as Ysimji. But there was a limit to humanity's travels, a wave of dark space surrounded Ysimji erasing power to those who went past. Millions were left stranded on the edges of civilization and soon we found ourselves receding into the light that provided for us. Few travelers went beyond the dark veil hoping to reclaim their families or find answers to what lies beyond, its obvious no one ever returned. Science failed us with this matter, the cage we found ourselves in did not adhere to the laws we knew. A dark chapter of humanity lasting several centuries went on slowly within that veil, at least until [[Aarand Vullan]] shattered it.
