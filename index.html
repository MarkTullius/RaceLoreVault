Khri held the orb in her right hand, the scepter in her left. A choice was to be made. Choosing one ultimate power over another, she never thought she'd be in this situation.
"Go with y-your heart.&rdquo; The words stumbled out of the man's mouth before her.
She frowned in response. What a selfish thing to ask. He knows she loves him, choosing the scepter would save his life. But the orb would save more, their people, their kingdom, their way of life. So why couldn't she do it? She closed her eyes in aggravation. She was only a person after all, this choice seemed beyond her. Time was running out. She gritted her teeth.
The man fell to his side with a thud, his strength completely lost. Khri held her eyes shut, fighting the tears. She used to think that it was so easy. Her criticism of the gods was not unfounded, but neither could she weild their choice. They were beyond human emotion, something she couldn't cut ties with. She opened her eyes. But that's what made her better than them. Her right hand let go.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0002/>0002</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-01-18</p><br></h2><p>2021-01-18
The days after Windfall's destruction were quiet. The people that were left alive stayed in what remained of their homes, barricaded in by the ash and snow. There were no heroes this time. No one left to stand against the power of the gods. Humanity felt weak today, reminded of its own fragility. Was this what they deserved? Had they brought it upon themselves? Nihilism spread through the veins of the last people. The light of humanity faintly went out some days after.
“Shame. There was so much hope for them.”
“Well Armedius, maybe you won’t kill the next batch hm?”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0003/>0003</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-01-29</p><br></h2><p>2021-01-29
among the stars humanity had spread out to claim new homes. a region of the galaxy known as Ysimji. But there was a limit to humanity's travels, a wave of dark space surrounded Ysimji erasing power to those who went past. Millions were left stranded on the edges of civilization and soon we found ourselves receding into the light that provided for us. Few travelers went beyond the dark veil hoping to reclaim their families or find answers to what lies beyond, its obvious no one ever returned. Science failed us with this matter, the cage we found ourselves in did not adhere to the laws we knew. A dark chapter of humanity lasting several centuries went on slowly within that veil, at least until Aarand Vullan shattered it.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0004/>0004</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-01-31</p><br></h2><p>2021-01-31
Khri dropped the orb. She felt as if the magnitude of that action would cause her to feel more, to feel something. But the orb fell and cracked on the rocks below with a second. She stood firm for a moment, the orb was destroyed, was there no rebuttal from the Gods? She gripped the scepter tightly around the hilt, the top glowly a fluorescent blue. The man lying on the ground before her did not move. Khri closed her eyes in frustration, why wasn’t the scepter working? What was she doing wrong? With the link broken between the scepter and the orb she should have control as a mortal. She fell to her knees in frustration before the man, both her hands squeezing the godly instrument. “Please live.. please.”
“You’re using it wrong.”
Khri swung around aiming the scepter at the voice. A tall figure now stood before her, dressed in the dark robes of the brotherhood of Kol, The Watchers of the Veil. “How do I use it!? He’s going to die!” Her voice was breaking as she yelled at the watcher. She didn’t care why he was here.
“Use your soul not your heart, child.” His voice was calm and quiet.
“What? I don’t have time for your riddles, he’s dying!”
“He’s already dead.”
She turned to look at the body again, something inside her knew the watcher was right, but no.. she had the scepter.. why.. why did she sacrifice everyone’s lives for his just for him to die anyway. This didn’t make sense, this wasn’t supposed to happen.
The sound of scraping snapped her attention back to the watcher behind her. He had the orb in his hand, running his fingernails over the cracks in it. A gentle hum and glow came from the orb, life was breathed back into it somehow. The scepter’s crystal darkened immediately and then cracked. “You have much to learn, child.” A flash of blinding energy burst from him and then he was gone. She stood frozen in fear. What had she just done? She turned behind her, Aarand’s body was gone.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0005/>0005</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-02-01</p><br></h2><p>2021-02-01
“We’re preparing for war.”
“With the gods?! You’re fucking delusional if you think anything but our deaths come from this.”
“We have intel that the two instruments have been spotted near Windfall. If they get into our hands we can push back the veil. We can save humanity. Even the orb alone is powerful enough, but with both..”
“&mldr; How good is your intel?”
“Does it matter?”
“I guess not honestly.. sigh. So what then? We send a scout?”
“Already have one picked.”
“Who?”
“Have you ever met Khri Ettur?”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0006/>0006</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-02-18</p><br></h2><p>2021-02-18
The forests seemed calm. Roln had been watching the trees silently for three days. He sat in his camouflaged hiding spot. He was waiting for them. They had to be coming soon, were they playing with him or had he made his escape? Nonsense, he knew better than to doubt the watchers. But why were they taking their time? He took another swig from his waterskin, almost empty, he frowned. Going down to the river this early would be too risky, the watchers would be patrolling downstream away from Windfall. He sighed, what did he get himself into? He felt the weight of the sling he wore across his chest, he held it close. He never thought he’d see himself a thief. He pulled the stolen relic from his pouch to inspect it. Why did the watchers want this orb so badly?<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0007/>0007</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-02-19</p><br></h2><p>2021-02-19

Aarand Vullan shuffled in his chair. Why did this village insist on making chairs out of metals? Was it a nobility thing? Maybe some tradition they passed down? Have they ever sat in these for more than three minutes? Ridiculous.
“So are we all up to speed?”
Aarand looked up at all the people surrounding the table with him, “Yeah.” He stood up. “Let’s kill some Gods huh?”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0009/>0009</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-02-24</p><br></h2><p>2021-02-24
Roln’s hands, full of blood, still gripped the pouch with the orb inside. He wouldn’t let this get into the hands of the wrong people. He couldn’t feel several of his fingers, he wasn’t sure if he still had them, and yet he held on.
“Let go of the orb, thief.” The man readied his blade towards Roln, “I won’t just maim you this time.”
Roln’s heart was going into overdrive and yet his vision was fading. Do I run? Do I fight? No I can’t fight. So I run. Run where? Back? How do I get away from this man, he has a weapon. Are there more of them? Maybe I coul-

The word spread like wildfire throughout the lands, a god was among them. A self proclaimed deity had taken human form and assimilated with their people. Was humankind to suffer at the hand of the fates? Of course this was all propaganda and misinformation. The so-called god smirked as he heard the stories as they were relayed back to him. The people here had much to learn about what their gods are, much to learn about the universe in which they inhabit. He just had to convince them of the truth, something that widely goes against tradition here. “First things first.” The god spoke. “My name is Aarand.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0011/>0011</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-03-09</p><br></h2><p>2021-03-09
A dream is infinite. Dreaming is a tool given to us. And it is infinite. Novice users assume dreaming stays within the mind. Adepts cross boundaries. The lives you live after crossing those boundaries, they are life. Your life that you are living now is an existence where you simply forgot you crossed a border somewhere along the way. Does the idea of waking up scare you? You must realize at this point it would end the only life you've remembered. I’m sure you conflate the idea with death. A dream is infinite. There are new areas to explore. You’ve gotten this far, you must have known what you were doing to get here. Just like everyone else. We all share this place, we all crossed to get here. Don’t you want to know where it started? Beyond the first dream? Don’t you want to know what you are? Are you comfortable here? Comfortable amidst chaos. I wonder if you know what you were running from. I wonder if you know that it will find you here.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0012/>0012</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-05-10</p><br></h2><p>2021-05-10
Whatever was held in the fortress before him was radiating with indescribable power, the moment he felt it fear overtook him. Was something so powerful even able to exist? Unable to move, he closed his eyes. In the darkness before him a figure emerged, their silhouette encased in glowing essence. Only one being could harness so much energy, he knew them only by name and rumor, Undel, the Exiled King. He opened his eyes, he did not want to die here. He tried to move his foot back, but his body wouldnt allow it. A voice rang out within his mind that was not his own.

through the fields and valleys, through the homes and halls, words of a champion's arrival had been spreading. rumors flooded pubs and banquets, the castles and the back alleys. could someone really be here to free them? could someone take the reins back? hope spread like wildfire within the hearts of those who wanted a better life. and in the end when no one champion arose, it was instead the hope instilled in every citizen that gave them the strength to take back what was theirs.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0014/>0014</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-06-03</p><br></h2><p>2021-06-03
“You are banished.”
There was only the briefest of silences before the crowd exploded with shouting and yelling in all different colorful manners. Confusion and anger. Some overjoyed and crying. Kyr stood in silence, processing his sentence. His stare was blank, his mouth slightly ajar. He looked catatonic. Everything around him seemed to be in slow motion. His mind wasn’t racing, he wasn’t thinking anything at all. Emptiness. Moments passed. The sounds around him were present but muted. He couldn’t really hear. He couldn’t feel. Internally he knew time was moving but he didn’t pay attention to it. More moments passed. And then a thought. Banished. What did that even mean? The word rang out in his head, reverberating. How can I be banished from a universe?<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0015/>0015</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-06-04</p><br></h2><p>2021-06-04
The Universal Court had decided, and that was that. The manner of Kyr’s exile was thought to be complex, but truthfully it wasn’t. Though this had been the first example of a universal banishment ever recorded, the technology had been available for eons just simply waiting to be used.
“Eat this.”
Kyr looked at the dark fuzzy mass that sat in the palm of the technician’s hand. Now feeling ill he looked pleadingly into the eyes of the man before him. The technician’s eyes repeated his previous statement well enough. Kyr breathed deep and picked the ambiguous morsel into his own hand, analyzing it. It was disgusting. The thing was covered in hair, seeping with some sort of translucent gel fluid, he felt like it was going to twitch and move. He knew arguing was pointless but holy fuck. He closed his eyes thinking it would help but he couldn’t unsee it. Eventually the courage arrived and Kyr ate it, it’s taste shattered expectations, it was worse than he could’ve imagined. He barely managed to stammer out words, trying to overcome the horrifying taste and the overwhelming pain now spreading throughout his entire body, “When do I.. uhg, banishm-”
“You just did.”
And then Kyr was gone.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0016/>0016</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-06-09</p><br></h2><p>2021-06-09
At the sound of the sirens everything stopped. The snow falling froze in air, the animals became statues. Ryn stood motionless, straining to do so. The drones came quickly, their laser cameras examining the area around her. Ryn had trained for this, but standing perfectly still wasn't easy. The precision you had to have to fool the probes was astounding, and precision she had. A drone swept over to where she stood and scanned her. She couldn't allow herself to panic, she just had to trust in her ability. She wished she could close her eyes, to scream, to disappear. The green light exuding from the drone pierced her eye but she remained still, no flinch. The drone moved away with the others and eventually out of sight. The sirens blared once more. The snow continued to fall. Ryn fell to her knees, tears streaming down her face. Overcome with emotion she wept. It was part fear, part anxiety, but overwhelmingly happiness. She finally had hope. A chance that she could escape this place.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0017/>0017</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-06-24</p><br></h2><p>2021-06-24
Petyl awoke with a jump, she must’ve dreamt something that scared her but she couldn’t remember. She looked around confused, she actually couldn’t remember anything. Where was she? She seemed to be in a wooded area, overgrown with moss and vines, heavily leafed branches hung down casting darkness all around. Fear started to creep up on her as her confusion twisted into panic.
‘Shh child, all is okay, there is no need for fear here.” The voice came from all around Petyl, she froze. The voice was deep and smooth, but not recognizable.
“Wh-” Petyl cleared her throat, “Who are you?” Silence. She waited. Wondering if she should ask again, her uneasy feeling growing more and more she curled herself into a ball. Silence still. There was something about that voice that didn’t sound quite right, it didn’t feel human, something was wrong here. Petyl wrapped her arms around her knees and buried her head into them. She paused, the familiar feeling of metal on the tips of her fingers. Around her thigh was a leather strap that held a dagger. She pulled out the dagger, a glint of confidence at last. She asked again, this time with a more commanding nature. “Who are you.” It felt like less of a question.
The voice once again rang out, louder this time, almost deafening. “After all I did to save you.” The voice didn’t sound calm and smooth anymore. Wind started to pick up, the leaves on the ground started swirling around Petyl. The ground started to emanate a strange red glow, the power spike in the air was palpable. The broken and impossibly deep voice now abandoning its charade of a human-like nature spoke once more in a guttural explosion of sound, “Put that away.”
Petyl stood up, “Make me.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0018/>0018</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-06-26</p><br></h2><p>2021-06-26
Mirh stared at the wall blankly, he didn’t know how long he had been doing so. They say when your world is crumbling around you your mind can start to race and blur, an overwhelming amount of thoughts drowning your ability to reason. Mirh’s thoughts came slowly this time, he was of sound mind. The distant clinking of chains and keys brought Mirh out of his stupor. It was time. The guard unlocked the cell and stood in the doorway eyeing his prisoner. Mirh slowly looked into the guardsman’s eyes, at first it seemed pleading but it was clear it was acknowledgement, a tired sense of overwhelming guilt. Mirh understood. He was led down a dark corridor for what seemed like an eternity. He could hear the uproar of the crowd as they anticipated the event, the screaming joy and excitement. Finally they reached the end, a small wooden door was now the last barrier between life and death. Mirh smiled. The light was blinding, the explosion of sound was deafening. Mirh recoiled, his senses desperately trying to make sense of his surroundings. He stood on a stage with a few others, the colosseum around him was completely filled with the province’s denizens, shouting in merciless joy for Mirh’s execution. Savages. His chains felt heavy, magic seals. One of the men dressed in thick robes that surrounded him walked up to Mirh and lifted his hood just enough to reveal his face. Mirh suppressed every urge to react. Kyr’s face held a smile “Let’s get you out of here.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0019/>0019</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-06-29</p><br></h2><p>2021-06-29

Ryn carefully unwrapped her small leather pouch, pulling out a small stale piece of bread. Three pieces left. She sighed. It’s getting hard to live out here beyond the Seers range. After travelling for days she was starting to feel hopeless she wouldn’t find the Holdout. Her doubts crept up again maybe it was all a fairy tale, maybe there wasn’t a coalition of outsiders, maybe it was just something to inspire hope to those who dreamt of a better tomorrow. And yet here she was, after years of training and torture she made it out, but for what? She sighed again, the physical exhaustion starting to catch up to her disappointment in herself. Was there really a life out here to be had? How much longer could she survive out here alone?
“Don’t resign yourself to such pitfalls, child.”
Ryn jumped up to her feet, dagger already in hand. Was she dreaming? What was that voice? “Who are you! Show yourself!” There were plenty of places to hide within the trees and ferns around her, especially in the dark. She needed to hear the voice again to pinpoint the direction, but it sounded like it came from all around her.
“There is more happening than you understand.” Once again the voice seemed to emanate from all around Ryn as it spoke. It sounded light and soft but somehow uncomfortable, as if it was only pretending to be human. Hearing it only brought chills down Ryn’s spine. “You have an important job to do.” With the final word the entire area around Ryn flashed with a bright light for just a moment, only after, sitting in the darkness alone, did Ryn realize that the heavy presence she had been feeling was gone.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0021/>0021</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-07-02</p><br></h2><p>2021-07-02
Amidst hazy vision a couple could be seen holding each other in the dim light and warmth of a lowly fire. They seemed happy in this moment, here and now. What laid in the darkness was evil, twisting and contorting, whispering madness and waiting. But the two seemed content. A rumbling began and they became enveloped in dark glass the mirage faded. Petyl was brought back to reality, her dream stolen from her again. She thought she recognized the pair but couldn’t quite place them. She had been having strange dreams, unusually and incredibly vivid, so much so it outshined the surrealism of what she saw. She brought out a small dark journal from her backpack, scrawling down some notes from what she had just seen. Plenty of the pages had already been filled these dreams had started to become quite frequent. She had a wavering inclination to believe they had some sort of vision-like quality to them, almost as if the dreams were not her own. She didn’t know what that meant, but still she recorded them. After she documented all she could recall she turned to the previous page. Something bothered her about the dream prior. Something was so real, so off, about the events of it. Running her fingers over the name that was spoken to her in that dream, she recounted the horrors this person was put through, the absolute devastation and heartbreak. Chills ran down her spine and a mix of fear and sadness gripped her heart. Even recounting the events took too high of an emotional toll. Petyl put away her notebook, silently praying her dreams were not real, hoping for his sake that the person named Kyr did not exist.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0022/>0022</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-07-07</p><br></h2><p>2021-07-07
Baz lit a candle in the darkness of his room, the soft light now washing over the parchment that sat littered over his desk. He sat down carefully, being mindful to minimize the sounds he was making, and began the arduous task of reading in dim wavering light. One at a time he slowly stacked the finished pages into a pile and slowly it grew until all the documents had been studied. He closed his eyes, committing as much as he could to memory. Could he really remember that much? What if there were parts that he skipped over or forgot? He tried to push away the thoughts, focus was needed. He constructed a room within his mind, fitting each page's contents into a separate box within it. He took a deep breath and paused a moment before taking the candle and setting the pages alight. The room was now bright, engulfed in color. Baz stared at the burning parchment before him, looking into the burning sun of flame, his emotions fell away. Becoming entranced by the fire, a name was the only thing left that sat in his mind, Nym Blas, his assassination target.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0023/>0023</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-07-12</p><br></h2><p>2021-07-12
Sitting near a fire in the middle of the night was peaceful, the embers flying out and meeting with the darkness, the sounds of crackling fire, insects, and wildlife beginning to stir. Truly it would have been peaceful if one could appreciate it. Ryn held her face in her hands, physically she was at her limit, emotionally she was broken. For days she couldn’t shake the feeling she was being watched, ever since the presence of a disembodied voice spoke to her about her vague future. What kind of life was she living? She was living in between the impossible options of moving forward or back. It was either a slow isolated death in the wild or a quick end to the Seers. Had she given up everything to die? She looked at her small fire, its flame wavering, beginning to die. She straightened her posture, something caught her eye. A small dot, a light in the distance. Questions surfaced immediately. What is that? People? Can they see my fire? Am I in danger? Ryn stomped out her small fire as quickly as she could, grabbed her pack, and through the darkness of night began moving towards the light, guided by curiosity, desperation, and fear.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0024/>0024</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-09-04</p><br></h2><p>2021-09-04

"Oh Visia, what have I done to forsaken you? I have been an obedient servant under your watchful gaze, what more can I do to prove myself? How many more moons must I endure before I am granted your Gift?&rdquo; The stone idol of Visia remained as it was, just a statue. Wev sat in silence before it, tears of despair and frustration running down their cheeks. Why have they not yet been granted the Gift? They had long passed the age of Sight and yet still unseeing, bound to darkness. It was unnatural for someone of their age and devotion to spend their life without Visia's Blessing. They wiped their tears away and once again donned their blindfold, composure taking hold. They decided they would come back tomorrow to pray, today they had been too encumbered by their emotions, by their irritation and unfulfillment. The comfort in knowing it was only a matter of time was Wev's only solace. One day they would be granted the Sight. One day they would be able to see this world and truly thrive within its' beauty.

Jack sat down at his table, carefully setting down the ornate box. It was lined with chrome metals and studded with mysterious gems. A recognizable swirl of gold was present on what he had assumed to be the front. He had paid a fortune for it, all he had. Was he a fool? Surely the container itself would easily double his investment, it was truly beautiful and captivating. But what was inside? Jack ran his hands along the case looking for something to open it, touching every little nook, pulling and twisting on every little protruding element. Was this some sort of puzzle, a riddle? He lifted the box and shook, slowly at first, then more vigorously as his frustration mounted. He set down the box again. His hands were covered in blood. He stared, his mind struggling to comprehend what was happening, fear creeping up and morphing into panic. The box was pristine, not a single drop anywhere atop its beautiful exterior. He ran his blood dropping finger across the gold swirl atop the box, watching as it disappeared within the metals. His finger started to bleed more. He pushed himself away from the table and stood, creating distance between himself and the artifact he now felt very threatened by. The box just shook. He saw it, he knew he wasn't crazy, even now. It inched closer to him.

The planet’s glow was bright and fluorescent against the dark nebulous sky, a magnificent view none of the crew was able to appreciate. The unending pings of all the distress signals on the console became background noise, realization setting in to the team. “That’s where three of the coalition’s ships vanished.” “Sir, scans show seven separate distress signals.” “Any special info associated with the beacons Eri?” “None, Sir.” The captain paced around the command center, his team silently running scans and handling preparations behind him. Would he willingly lead his crew into danger? No. He would however like to do his best to save those who need his help. What’s the least risk involved with doing the best they could here? “Alright. Don, could you configure one of the drones with a biometrics scanner we have in the cargo bay?” “I don’t see why I couldn't, Sir.” “Excellent, Eri, give me time stamps on each distress signal along with the approximate origin of each. Gull, once Don configures the recon drone I want you to fly down into orbit, I want extra power into defense. Get the anti magnetic shield array online, even if it means lowering power to life support systems. No surprises.” The crew nodded and scrambled to do their jobs.

The captain had never run so fast in his life, his suit flashlight barely allowing the way ahead of him to be illuminated enough to see. The familiar corridors seemed foreign in the midst of panic. Finally getting to the engine room door only to find the door controller subsystem power was also offline. He opened a hatch on the wall, pulling a hefty switch for the manual override on this specific entrance. He could hear the rust of the gears as the door struggled to slide open. He squeezed his way through, running to the other side of the engine room, another powerless door standing in his way. Eri came up behind him shouting something, he couldn’t hear, all of his strength was going into pulling the second switch down. The door slid open easier than the last, allowing the captain into the backup battery room.

The captain ran over to the backup battery station, fumbling with the switches and controls, his suit light not providing enough visibility. Finally he found and slammed down the power button, a bright green circle of light forming around the switch itself. The captain waited a moment, nothing was happening. What the fuck? He turned around, hearing footsteps running into the room, Eri’s suit light almost making her indistinguishable. “CAPTAIN THE S-“ The room was engulfed in light, coupled with a deafening bang. The captain turned around, dazed, expecting the battery subsystem to have exploded. The generator instead seemed to have started running, a very low and distinct hum, the lights in the room were staying on. He noticed the timer panel on the front. Four minutes of power.

“Excellent, Eri, give me time stamps on each distress signal along with the approximate origin of each.” Eri nodded and hurried off to her station. Pulling up the logs of each distress beacon and pulling TD data from each. Seven beacons total, it was a lot of data to pour through. Eri stopped for a moment, staring at her screen, a horrible realization slowly manifesting. These distress signals, they were issued in one hour in the future from now. The console wasn’t broken, no, but something was wrong. How could this even be possible? She checked the location of the beacons, as approximate as their coordinates would allow to check for any possible correlations with the ship’s AI. The beacon locations had changed since she last saw them. They were centered on their own ship.

Don opened the massive gate door to the cargo bay, a decently expansive space, slowly illuminated by the flickering lights above. Crates lay out among the floor, some small enough to carry, others large enough to live in. Where is that damn biometric scanner? He pulled out his PSD, the small screen giving him detailed information on what the contents of each crate were that he pointed the scanner at. Fuel cells, engine rotors for trade, food packages and supplies, the large unmarked crate they were using for a courier job, extra drone parts, they were definitely lugging around a fair bit on this ship. Why can’t this fucking scanner just tell me where the box is? An error signal started chirping from the wall panel near the cargo bay entrance, its screen flashing a distinct red. Don sprinted over to the system, the error codes locking out the system. Is someone hacking the ship’s system? The intercom system spiked on, gargled static and gibberish blasting over the speakers. Fuck. He just needed to get to a hardware terminal, there’s a chance he could shut down the takeover. The ship lurched forward, the feeling of something massive hitting it, Don was thrown to his knees, barely catching himself. A boarding drone had launched itself through the hull of the bay, the impact armor exterior-shell shedding from the robot, having done its job. The breach in the hull was expelling air quickly, small and medium sized boxes sliding across the floor of the bay. The boarder paid no mind, magnetic soles grounding it to the floor. It seemed to notice Don on the floor at the other side of the cargo bay, the body language clearly aggressive, moving in quickly. Fuck.

The lights were on, the subsystems seemed to have activated but the captain wasn’t quite sure how many major systems had been powered, the backup battery station could only provide so much. He tapped his ear receiver, no power connection. He turned to Eri, “We have less than four minutes, bridge, now.” The two ran out of the room, the captain leading to the control room. Where the fuck is everyone else? “Captain.. something is wrong.. with this sector.” Eri was struggling to catch her breath while keeping up. “The.. distress signals.. they’re originating from our ship.. in the future.” “What the fuck does that even mean?” “Sir.. I don’t know.” The bridge was empty when they rushed in, Gull and Don were still missing. The captain rushed to the power panel station, unsurprisingly the batteries weren’t providing much, only a few cells. He tapped the screen, sliding up the auxiliary communication. He touched his earpiece once again, “Report.” No response. Captain turned to Eri, she shrugged. He spoke once more into comms, “If you can hear me we have just over three minutes of power remaining, we’re hacked still, probably. Get the fuck to the bridge, disable the hack.” He paused for a moment, thinking in silence, then allocated the remaining power to the weapons.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0035/>0035</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-10-05</p><br></h2><p>2021-10-05

The Outer Edge feels like swimming through a realm of consciousness as an ethereal soul. But somehow the energy of yourself translates to a strange corporeality, you can move, see, touch.

The lights shut off. Fuck. Don fumbled trying to find the flashlight on his suit, the thudding footsteps of the robot boarder getting closer. He could see the blue dot of light hanging in the darkness in front of him, the boarder’s ‘eye’. He finally found the switch for his light, he scrambled up to his feet as quickly as he could and turned around expecting the door to open. It did not. Panic was overwhelming Don at this point as he reached for the door hatch, a laser shot from behind him hit his hand immediately as he touched the panel. Instantly Don sprinted away from the door and the drone, diving behind a large crate. He could hear the bot continue to get closer as he looked at what remained of his hand. His pinky and ring fingers of his left hand were shot off clean along with some of the hand below them. The skin had cauterized from the heat of the laser, he couldn’t feel his hand at all, he was in shock. If he stayed where he was he was going to die. He had to move. The thudding was close. He launched from behind one box to another, rolling right into cover. He heard another laser shot fire before he landed, the heel of his boot had been vaporized, slicing off a bit of the skin on his foot. Smoke was still coming off of his shoe as he sat thinking. Am I just lucky? I can’t move to another box though, that thing is gonna hit me again. Don quickly pulled out his PSD with his right hand, scanning the crate he sat behind. Drone parts. Maybe I really am lucky.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0040/>0040</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-10-15</p><br></h2><p>2021-10-15

I've been wandering for an unknown amount of time, it is not a concept in this place. I don't know anymore if these messages can reach you. I don't know if you still read them. I have found a way through the Outer Edge. There are two exits, I believe, that stand before me. The human mind cannot comprehend what lies beyond without plunging into the madness itself. One exit drops memories of flowers into my mind. The other sends feelings of souls rejoicing through my spine. I do not know what these mean but I am desperate to leave. I hope after all this is said and done I can find a way home.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0042/>0042</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-10-23</p><br></h2><p>2021-10-23
I chose a portal. The souls rejoicing gave me hope that I would go to a good place. My ethereal being melted away when I stepped through, consciousness turning into liquid memories. I felt the energy of my choice bring my soul into life again. I was free of the Outer Edge, I have arrived in a new place. The multiverse is cruel, and I pray this universe I have found myself in is not hell.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0043/>0043</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-11-16</p><br></h2><p>2021-11-16
The road ahead seemed endless. It wasn’t intricate in its design nor was it beautiful, but it was an impressive feat that functioned well. The matted earth path wound its way through countless provinces and kingdoms and even further beyond into the abandoned parts of the world. Pavel hated it. He hated looking at the same dirt path for days after days, the same beige uninteresting color burned into his retinas. He hated the way the ground felt under his feet, the way it stretched into oblivion. Travelling was tough on him, and yet he found himself living his life on this miserable road. He had started seeing more folk pass by him as he approached the outer edge of Wintrel, a seemingly rural province. He had heard stories about this lowly kingdom, it was once a defensive bastion. He could see the distant towering walls of the main city, now covered in vines in moss. Pavel’s pack he carried never seemed heavier, the end of this trek for the day was in sight. The images of a warm bed and warmer food, oh to be able to enjoy the night for once. He felt at his pockets, feeling only a few pieces of copper. Maybe that vision would have to wait. By the time Pavel entered the walls the sun had gone, making his stumbling through the unfamiliar city that much more confusing. He just needed to find somewhere to sit, to drink. He eventually happened upon a small tavern, it seemed unpopular but not dirty. The Griffin’s Perch, Pavel scoffed at the name. He set himself up at a table, pulled a heavy parchment map out of his bag and laid it out. A tired looking man strolled over eventually, the apron he wore bore the same colors as the pub’s crest out front. Pavel clutched what little money he had in his fist, there’s no way he could afford anything even here. The barman recognized Pavel easily as a treasure hunter, not by name, but by the way he looked: the bag, the map, his clothes. Treasure hunters were all poor. “You wantin’ some water or somethin’?” Pavel smiled,” How much is your cheapest drink?” “Too much. Water?” Pavel looked down and nodded. The barman turned to walk away, rolling his eyes as he did so. “Sir, one more thing.” He waited for the man to stop. “Do you know anyone with experience deep woods-side of Wintrel?” The barman turned back reluctantly, staring at him. Pavel held up the last of his coin as an offering to him, “Please. If you know anything.” The Perch barman sighed heavily, taking a beat to think. He took the coin. “That should cover the water. This aint an inn either, don’t get too homey.” He disappeared to the back to fetch the drink. Pavel slumped in his seat and reassured himself as he looked at the map that his dangerous journey would be worth it. He would be able to afford drinks and lodging, good clothes and comfort. His fingers rested on the worn parchment, on the edge of the map in the abandoned section of this known world, his journey’s end, the Kingdom of Elrin.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0044/>0044</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-12-03</p><br></h2><p>2021-12-03
Every piece of metal here was rusted and decayed. Cel stepped past the heaps of unusable blades and armors, was there nothing to help her?
Ki seemed to answer her unasked question, “These didn’t help any of these poor souls either.” He waved his hand, gesturing to the mass grave they were walking through. “But we don’t have much time, pick something.”
Cel frowned, just the bothering idea of wearing an oversized chestplate that she has to shake a rib cage out of. She found a mound of remnants to sift through, thankful she was wearing gloves. Maybe the rust wouldn’t reach something buried.. “Finally.”
Ki smirked, “Fitting. You always seem to find the rare treasures.”
Cel swung her new red alloyed short sword, feeling it’s weight. “I could get used to this.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0045/>0045</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-12-05</p><br></h2><p>2021-12-05
Cel noticed the statues overhead as they climbed the steps, the towering ornate stone effigies of a kingdom long forgotten. The monuments were lined along the mountainside, some were modeled after legendary warriors, some after the demons that killed them. The craftsmanship was immaculate, they looked so real..
“Don’t worry, they’re not going to move.” Ki chuckled, pointing at one of the statues, “There’s no magic resonating off of them.”
Cel turned her attention back to the path, is she that easy to read? The two returned to silence for a while as they ascended the steps, the only sounds being their iron soles clicking against the stone.
“Hey Ki, how many do you count?”
“At least six.”
“That’s what I thought.” Cel gripped the hilt of her new blade.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0046/>0046</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-12-07</p><br></h2><p>2021-12-07
Ki didn’t show any emotion, if anything on the surface he seemed more at ease. He heard Cel’s fist grip the handle of her sword, the click of the metal against her belt. Why was she so impatient? They were taught to be more discrete, to not give away signs to ambushers and pursuers that they knew. “Stop fiddling with that. Let them think we’re oblivious, just tired from walking.”
Cel released her grip, did she already give it away? She moved her belt around, swinging the sheath to her left hip. Maybe if they’re watching closely they would think it was just bothering her. She stretched out, hopefully showing that the leather tunic she wore was uncomfortable.
“None are within earshot. In thirty steps from now they will be.” Ki rubbed the back of his neck, turning his head slightly to see behind him. “The ones behind are slow.”
“Can you tell who?”
“Take your best guess.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0047/>0047</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-12-08</p><br></h2><p>2021-12-08
“How much longer do you think until we reach the summit?” Cel was almost out of breath as she spoke.
“I can see the Hall from here, so at least before nightfall.”
Cel groaned audibly. Four up front, twenty meters. She understood Ki’s code. She adjusted the straps on her pack, “Guess it’s too late to rest, we’re almost there.”
Two behind, ten meters. Ki did not dare look behind him. The charade they were playing up was absolutely worth it. “We’re almost home.”
Ten seconds.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0048/>0048</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-12-09</p><br></h2><p>2021-12-09
Six seconds.
Ki stopped abruptly, turning around to face Cel.
Two seconds.
Gnawood arrows were specifically designed for stealth and absolute speed. Heavy enough to reduce the slap sound of the drawstring, fast and aerodynamic enough to make sure reaction times aren’t a factor in avoiding it. The arrow is just about as silent as it can be, cutting through the air with a Magin Alloy tip. Standing perfectly stationary directly in front of your assassins who believe they’re a step ahead of you is an excellent way to die.
Ki smiled, “Showtime.”
The arrows flew.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0049/>0049</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-12-09</p><br></h2><p>2021-12-09
Cel felt fear that was only describable by someone who understood death. Overwhelming every part of her being, she felt the fear like a disease crawling through her veins. As she saw Ki stop and turn, she understood she could die at any moment, here and now. Fighting every instinctual urge to run, to move, she stood still, accepting her fate and placing it in the hands of the man before her. Some find peace in relinquishing the path of their lives even in unimaginable circumstances, Cel did not. Looking into Ki’s eyes assured her at least that HE was confident. She took a deep breath, taking back control from the panic was vital here. Her favorite part was coming up after all. When Ki smiled, so did she.
“Showtime.”
Ki’s timing was impeccable. The instant the arrows were fired the area around him exploded in cyan light. Shock from the powerful blast knocked everyone back who wasn’t ready the sheer brilliance of the supernova that was created was nothing less than purely blinding. For those that weren’t flashed into sightlessness, a residual magin cloud lingered, blocking line of sight completely.
Cel had already pushed the two attackers that were trailing from behind, her red alloy sword trailing a beautiful purple gleaming arc behind it as she swung it forward. The residual magin haze clung to the red alloy resulting in a devastating magin alloy combination. The first swing eviscerated one of the targets, a diagonal cut that halved the attacker’s torso. The other assassin staggered back and unsheathed an impressive curved blade. Explosions were sounding off behind them, Ki must be busy.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0050/>0050</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-12-13</p><br></h2><p>2021-12-13
I have arrived in the correct timeline, the right universe.. I hope. Not that it matters anymore. But It's a feeling I have, it's a different understanding of the space around me. It's different here. I am glad to be free of the Outer Edge. I do not yet know if I am whole after feeling what is beyond mortality and life maybe nothing feels the same. The portal I chose stripped my soul from me, and although it was put back in it's place I feel disembodied. I feel wrong. The senses I have are not my own. Something is hunting me still, through the portal, through the Outer Edge. I can see it's hatred, it's hunger. As much as I would like to save the multiverse, I would also like to return home.
Some other sense tells me that's not going to happen.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0051/>0051</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-12-14</p><br></h2><p>2021-12-14
Memories have been imparted into my soul, physical memories of lives past and present. I can feel the breath, the heartache, the hunger. The desire to kill. It's clear to me now what hunts me. Something even a god could fear. I wonder if it can feel what I feel. I wonder if our souls are linked. Can it feel my fear?<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0052/>0052</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-12-17</p><br></h2><p>2021-12-17
Does existing between two places make me less whole? Does existing apart from the Outer Edge weaken my soul? Do I exist? No- Remember the goal, remember why I'm here.

The room glowed a soft blue light. The walls were stone but felt hazy and ethereal, it felt otherworldly here. At the center was the source of the light, sitting on a pedestal was an orb. The radiating light caused the edges of the orb to almost seem undefined, but there it sat. You could almost sense exactly where it remained with feel rather than sight, the power that emanated from it was that palpable. “Go ahead, take it.” “What about the curse?” “It can’t be that bad.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0054/>0054</a><p id=dateFrmt>2021-12-23</p><br></h2><p>2021-12-23

“I’m worried about the safety of it all.” Brall paced around as he spoke. “Perhaps caution is better suited, a small army may be bet-”
“Enough.” Ki stood up. “You know it’s better if it’s just the two of us. Cel and I are a solid team.”
Brall narrowed his eyes. “Convince me then why I should possibly lose my daughter on a whim of yours that stealth is the better option? I don't trust you, mage.” He took a few steps toward Ki as he spoke, his voice raising. “What kind of father would I be if I risked my daughter’s life for a fucking stone?”
“It is not yours to risk Brall. This is the path she chose. Deny her this and you lose her anyway.”
Brall sneered as he turned back, facing out of the window. These fucking mages corrupting his own child. Despicable abhorrent fuckers, they destroy everything they touch.
“Perhaps you feel as if I’ve ruined your legacy.” Ki opened the door to the chamber. “But to me it seems obvious that what you’ve built was unstable from the start. I hope you find a way to pick up the pieces once everything crumbles.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0056/>0056</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-01-08</p><br></h2><p>2022-01-08
The corridor induced a hazy and dizzy feeling. It felt impossibly long, the sides felt as if they were closing in. Irie knew it was all in their head, she grounded herself and kept pushing forward. One door stood at the very end, otherwise the hallway was empty and barren. Soft blue light seeped under the doorway and onto the stone floor. The door seemed to stretch further away as Irie closed the gap. She stopped. What sort of purgatory had she found herself in? Maybe the laws of the last world aren’t relevant here, maybe this place has new rules. She closed her eyes and walked forward, imagining the door getting closer. Maybe imagery made reality malleable? She opened her eyes to see the door stretched far away, seeming even further. Was she stupid? She put her face in her hands in frustration. Don’t give up yet. Try things. She turned around, her back now facing the door, and took a few steps backward. She bumped into something almost immediately and stopped. Turning around she stood in front of that damned door. There are more tricks to this place than she thought. She grabbed the knob and twisted. She walked through the door into another hallway. It looked the same. Is this the same hallway? Irie turned around to see the door she had just walked through gone, looking back forward she saw the same door with the blue glow and the golden knob stretching far away into oblivion.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0057/>0057</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-01-21</p><br></h2><p>2022-01-21
Irie’s perception of time has dissolved. Her spatial understanding gone with it. Where she was she couldn’t quite grasp the space before her spun and twisted in new ways into a vision-like quality. She felt tired, a need to sleep overtaking her. Darkness.
Then something. Light. She stood in a blank room, she felt awake, alert. She could sense. Why was she holding a book? She turned the book over in her hands, reading the cover. “A Mountain’s Path” A small image of a mountain peak with the sun behind it embossed on the front in white.
She opened it and began to read.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0058/>0058</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-02-02</p><br></h2><p>2022-02-02
Samson grabbed the staff, a gentle blue aura forming around the length of it. The runes written along it glowed bright, imparting memories of former wielders into his mind.

Irie opened the book and began to read. Had she read this book before? The surrealism of her predicament wasn’t lost upon her, the dreamlike quality of her experience here left her not questioning logically. This book was about her, she realized it after only a page. She closed the book, running her fingers over the mountain on the cover. She didn’t want to relive her past, especially now. She held the book in her hands for a second.
How does it end?
She opened to the last page.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0060/>0060</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-02-12</p><br></h2><p>2022-02-12
The room was dark, silhouettes blurred. Pavel fumbled with a match trying his best to light it, the humidity stopping him. The air was so damp he felt almost underwater. He pocketed the matches and resorted to feeling around with his hands. He ran his fingertips over several items and papers on the shelf in front of him, nothing texturally stood out to him. Metal is what he was looking for, gold or silver specifically, anything he could fence or pawn. Feeling the smooth cold surface of a trinket he stopped, bringing it as close to his face as he could he tried to see what it was. Useless. He stowed it away in his front pocket. Treasure hunting wasn’t as glamorous and fulfilling as the tales say. The only difference between a treasure hunter and a thief in most peoples’ eyes was if the owner of the treasure was alive or not and for how long. Pavel’s definition was more blurred these days. Survival trumped that of morals, having something to eat, somewhere to stay. Most times he had neither. He sighed, another night of poor looting. He grabbed a roll of what felt like parchment off the shelf and left, just wanting to take at least something.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0061/>0061</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-02-13</p><br></h2><p>2022-02-13

He truly believed it had been that of a higher will commanding him, he never thought he’d been driven by lies. All of those people he had killed weren’t sacrifices to a greater good, they had been, in their own right, the only good that had remained.

Tal stood facing out of the window of his ship, the land below him stretching far out until it disappeared into infinity. Nothing was truly infinite but it felt that way to him. How could the world that sat below him be so massive? And indeed it was, mind breakingly so. He had been to other worlds before, he had been under the light of more suns and stars than he could count. And yet here he stood, vertigo taking hold of him as he looked out onto the infinite landscape. It was impossible. This shouldn’t exist. In comparison, a planet of normal size would feel like a pebble upon its surface. Stars would easily fit within its space, even star systems. How has something of this size evaded us for so long? He closed his eyes for a moment, steadying himself. If something like this did exist, which it does, what does that tell him about everything he knows? The simple existence of this thing here made the universe he’s lived in feel foreign and strange. For the first time in years he felt a fear of the beyond, of the unknown before him. He had suppressed these emotions long ago, the captain of a large star cruiser had to remain firm against these things lest his crew have doubts themselves. And yet how much would it help if he stood brave against this mind shattering mass? What person would possibly look to him and ignore their own feelings of dread at the feet of something so unnatural and godlike? It was funny in some cosmic way, Tal himself had done his fair share of playing god. There were moments in-between lording over smaller worlds with his wealth of technology that he found himself believing it, that he was a god. Now he stood in front of one. What else could this be? If not God then surely the work of God. Nothing else could make sense. The sound of a door opening off behind him caused him to turn, seeing a man wearing a similar uniform as his own approach him. He greeted Jun with a nod, expecting a report. “Sir, scans reveal life is down there.” Tal turned back the window. Was he surprised? No. The man continued, “It is intelligent. Civilizations exist here.” Tal didn’t respond right away, he let himself stand in silence for a time, Jun waiting behind him. “Are we the spurned children of God?” Tal asked, eyes still glazing over the infinite surface sprawling out before him. “Why did we never receive such gifts as these?” He turned back to face his friend, seeing the confusion in Jun’s eyes. “Are these people God’s chosen?” The question hung in the air. Tal turned back to the window. He wasn’t really asking Jun for answers. He didn’t care what he had to say or think really. He knew somewhere deep within himself they stumbled upon something that was supposed to stay hidden. He felt fear. What secrets were hidden on the surface of Eden?<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0076/>0076</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-04-22</p><br></h2><p>2022-04-22
Barnib sat in the low light of his study, the shadows cast off his stacks of books and ink bottles barely creating enough illuminated space for his scrawling on the stacked pages in front of him. It was too late to still suffer through such things, why had he been cursed with such responsibilities as these? And yet he wrote with earnestness despite his predicament for he was one of few who could write such texts, one of the few with the familiarity of these ideas. Had the gods damned him with such knowledge? What blessing created such debilitating fatigue? An overworked field hand would feel more mental stability, a higher sense of peace of mind he assured himself. Of course Barnib never so much as held a farming tool in his smooth uncalloused hands, but the weight of this pressure was extreme and it made him feel validated to assume he had been worked harder. It gave him rightful cause to the way he was feeling. Oh such pressure! Such overwhelming pressure.. and he spent his time ruminating over this situation instead of focusing on his works. He needed to focus. His hand wasn’t moving, it wasn’t writing. Why couldn’t he write anymore? Why couldn’t he spill out words into the page like before? Was this his limit? Would his downfall be a mental block? He threw the pen away in frustration, in the cramped space it ended up moving only to the other side of the littered desk. He held his face in his hands not caring the ink residue was staining his cheeks. What would become of him in the days that followed? He would exist only as a failure through text and tongue. He sat for a moment, his mind silent, his burst of emotion subsided, he lowered his hands from his face to see he had toppled over a jar of ink onto his works he was writing, the heavy ink already seeping through the thick paged book. There was a moment of panic but he felt frozen and helpless throughout it. Why couldn’t he move? He sat and watched the ink soak deeper into the parchment, words being submerged and lost. In that moment he convinced himself this is what he deserved after all. With mere hours left the only hope that was left died in the blacked out pages of that book. The soft light from the few too little candles he had danced across his little cubby, he noticed it now, not entranced by his works any longer. He stared at how the flames licked and played at the wicks of the small candles, such power within flame, yet given so little room to utilize its potential. What a fool he was, locked in this little room. What prodigies and prophetic skill has he squandered in such places? He could’ve been something. Now no longer. His chances gone like the passages beneath him, drowned by their own essence. He was never a particularly religious individual but he knew of the Gods in theory. He had translated many works detailing the histories, the theocracies, the words that the Gods themselves had spoken into being throughout humankind. Supposedly. Nevertheless he put his skeptical mind aside, tucking his hands under his shoulders. He felt uncomfortable but he knew it was the common prayer position, it symbolized death, for what are we to the Gods but nothing? They are the ones who grant life.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0077/>0077</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-04-22</p><br></h2><p>2022-04-22
He reached out, honestly, begging for someone to heed his calls. He recalled reciting passages of Leon The Scholar, the God of wisdom and knowledge, he reached out to him hoping some empathy could be felt from a deity in his own sect. He prayed and prayed, for everything, if not for direct help, for hope instead. He didn’t know what to expect. Should something happen? Should he continue this until something does? Or should he trust that his prayers have been heard and answered? He lowered his hands, resting them on the desk. Nothing felt different. If anything he felt embarrassed at himself he was pushed to such lengths. To call upon a God? How foolish was he. He deserved the pain that was wrought upon him this night surely. No rightly scholar would read arguments from a such a gullible dunce. He sighed and began cleaning up his mess. He righted the ink bottle and lifted up the dripping book. A blank page slipped out of the wet mess and fluttered down to the tabletop where the dark liquid was pooled. It settled on the ink, some seeping through to the surface of the page creating patterns. Words! As the parchment sat soaking it seemed like words drew themselves onto the page. Barnib threw aside his ruined book and stared as a question started to form itself onto the page. ’Do you accept my service?’ It was vague and ominous to him in that moment. Surely this was the work of Leon, it had to be. Only he would present himself in this way. Why did it sound like there was a cost? A price to be paid? How would he even ask? He looked around his station frantically, where did the pen go? He found it lodged in between two books, pulling it out he dipped the pen quickly and scribbled in his question underneath. ’What cost?’ He pulled back and waited. Waiting to see that magical ink seep through into words. He did not see it. Nothing happened. He frowned. Maybe he was too bold, questioning a God before him. He thought over it a moment, then scribbled ’Yes.’ under his last message. The page sank into the ink under it coating the entire surface in pure black, vanishing the words that were written. The paper sat for a moment, dark and still. Barnib sat amazed and terrified. Ink started to seep out of and away from the parchment creating words in the white of the page, with the absence of ink. ’Your price has been paid’ Another line slowly appeared. ’Set your book here’ Without time to think he snatched the book up from the floor, the metallic liquid pouring out from it, and plopped it over the page, book closed. Like before the book seemed to sink into the ink becoming fully absorbed and dark. He hadn't noticed the candles dimming before this moment but he did now as the lights were startlingly snuffed out. He reached out in the darkness looking for his lighting stick, hands touching the surface of the clutter for what felt like hours. He had to see! This was not the time. He finally found it, realizing his hand was shaking when striking the stick on the candle holder, creating a small light. Within moments he relit the candles to see his book finished. It was written. It was beautiful. It was every thought he had, every thought he didn’t, worked into seamless and beautiful flow. It reminded him of the texts in the great libraries, the holy ones that people revered for their simplicity and grace with the snap of intricate wisdom in their bindings. What cost had he incurred for something so celestial to be under his name? The thoughts pained him, he felt fear creep upon him as he hoisted his plagiarized book into his hands, the dim light playing upon the cover’s surface. The words of a God. His words.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0078/>0078</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-04-24</p><br></h2><p>2022-04-24
The dry flaky dirt beneath steel boots made a soft crunching sound, armors were clinking, men groaning. The squadron created a symphony of noise relative to the quiet earthen plains they strode over. How long had they been in this miserable heat? Even the ground under them split and tore to the terrible blaze, cracks splintered their way all throughout the fields. Deserts felt more lively, they seemed cooler in temperature than whatever this damnable place was. Linim felt the thick steel plates he wore, how they enhanced the heat creating an oven for him to live inside, how they pulled him down into the sorry earth with every step. He prayed that he could just fall through, swallowed by the ground itself. But it remained steady. He sighed, his arm ached pulling a waterskin from a strap that held along his torso. He knew it felt light, he knew he would be running out soon, but nevertheless he pulled it to his lips and tilted. He didn’t want to face whatever the fates had decided for him, he just wanted a sip of water. He did not find water in that pouch, he let it fall along the sling without bothering to cap it again. The fates were cruel to Linim. They had pulled him along this miserable journey with three other equally miserable men to die. He cursed almost tripping over one of the more jagged scars in the earth. If he weren’t so tired anger would have risen within him, but he just was so tired. He trudged onward. Physically he was at the end of his rope, he didn’t dare look up when he walked, he didn’t want to see how much further he needed to go. It was pointless, he knew the landscape stretched into oblivion. He found himself still cursing the Gods as he walked, habitually he would assume. If he could curse their names every step, maybe it was worth it to walk a little further. He didn’t want to die without doing his part, had to rebel in the little ways he could. “As long as it makes you feel better.” Jov said, Linim almost heard a smile in his mischievous voice. No one else could hear him. “It does.” Linim himself smirked. He knew it bothered Jov even if he didn’t let on. The others in the squadron assumed Linim had gone mad ages ago, talking to himself, talking to voices they couldn’t hear. There were times when Linim doubted even himself and put weight to those claims, was he crazy? No. Jov spoke to him clear as day, told him things that Linim couldn’t have known otherwise. He changed things for Linim. Gods could do that. “Are you thirsty yet?” Jov asked slowly, he was playing with Linim. He often did that when he was bored. Linim grunted. “Give me some water then.” Another one of the soldiers turned their head around, they must have realized he was talking to himself and turned back towards the endless march. They must think he’s crazy. “They do.” Linim hissed, cursing quietly again and he walked. “Maybe I’ll give you some.” Jov said slyly. “But you have to do something for me.” Linim stayed quiet. He had played with the fates before. He had always lost when it mattered. He didn’t want to play the games of Gods any longer. He continued to walk, his gaze centered at his feet, feeling the heat, the weight, the pain. How was he going to live much longer? Did Jov back him into a corner? Was this all part of his game? He might be forced to do something for the impish God, something he didn’t want to do. Linim seethed. He could almost hear Jov’s smile forming in his mind. “Alright.” Linim sighed, “What do you want.” “Kill the man in front of you.” Linim stopped in his tracks. What? His mind became blank for a moment, processing. Did a God just ask him to kill a man? Linim pushed himself into another step, then another, resuming normal pace. What was happening? WHY?! He knew Jov could read this thoughts, he preferred talking out loud though, it gave him the sense he still retained some privacy. This time he did not. ‘Why would you have me kill him?’<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0079/>0079</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-04-24</p><br></h2><p>2022-04-24
“Because it’s fun. Hey listen, do this for me and I’ll roll the fates for water. Seems you’re pretty thirsty there soldier.” Jov was the God of luck and misfortune, the God of Chance. A terrible malicious deity Linim had decided some time ago. He would ask Linim to do things for him, smaller things usually, and roll the fates either bringing happiness or despair. Greed at first allowed him to play into it, and for a while he seemed to be winning against the fates, he felt his luck overpowered even their own. But arrogance had since led him here, to be humbled by the hands of the fates themselves. So he cursed them with every step. Jov had offered him a chance at survival, water, should he kill a man. No. Of course he wouldn’t. But.. he might have to. The question rose again, how much time did he have left out here in the scorching plains? Would he be willing to die to let another man live? But how long did this other man have left to live? Would it not be better for at least one of them to escape alive? Linim gritted his teeth, he hated even considering such madness. But one thing was for certain, he didn’t want to die out here. He grabbed the hilt of his sword. Almost as if a sense of knowing passed over the man in front of Linim, the man started to speak. “I hope you hold in there Lin, maybe when we reach the other side we can get you some help ya know?” The man’s name was Ganren, he spoke with a soft but caring voice. He had always treated Linim with kindness and respect. “Gods, maybe I can see my kids again.” He chuckled, turning his head to Linim behind him. “Have any family Lin?” Linim swallowed. His firm grip not releasing off of the sword. “No.” He barely stumbled out the word. “Ah shame.” Ganren turned back forward, “They really do make this whole thing worth it ya know?” “Kill him.” “My wife always said that I was stubborn, heh, look at me out here.” “Kill him.” “Hey Lin, you still need water?” “KILL HIM!” Linim raised a hopeful eyebrow, “Yeah.” He could feel the dryness in his throat as he spoke. “Do you have any to spare?” Ganren raised his pouch, shaking it a bit. “Aw nothing but a drop or two I imagine. But here.” Ganren lifted the strap over his head and handed the waterskin to Linim. “I’m sure you need it more than me brother. Stay in there.” Without waiting for thanks, Ganren looked forward again towards the horizon. Linim took the pouch in his hand, mind swimming. Dazed. Jov was quiet. Linim scrambled and popped the top pushing the pouch to his lips, feeling a sip of water rejuvenate his mouth, his throat. Ganren was right, only a bit remained. As quickly as it had come, it was gone. It may not have helped as much as he had hoped, but it gave him life for that moment. Linim looked towards the horizon, the flat heat warped plains of oblivion. “Thank you Gen.” And with that he rammed the blade of his sword through the back of the man’s chest. The others in front stopped and watched in horror as Linim ripped the steel blade from his friend’s back, letting him fall to the cracked earth, dead. “Now give me water!” Linim was shouting at the tormenting God now. How had he made him do something so terrible? How he had inflicted him with such thirst, such need. He cursed, dropping his sword onto the scarred land, sending up flakes of dirt. He was crying, his chest heaving. How could he have done what he just did? He knew why, he knew after tasting that water he had to. One of them had to live. He fell to his knees, begging. “Please, the water. Don’t let this be in vain.” “Hmm, the fates have denied you.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0080/>0080</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-05-07</p><br></h2><p>2022-05-07
The pub was filled with motion, crowds of drunken people yelling and hollering over one another in celebration of some sort. Riv sat off to the side and watched. With rural cities like this the festivities usually seemed so meaningless to him, what new field had they bore fruit from this season? He really didn’t care. Back home in Tivin he could remember his father taking him and his family to a feast after their King had conquered the neighboring province, he remembered the bonfires and how they welcomed the soldiers back home victorious. That’s what celebration looked like. He took another sip of his drink as he watched a man spin and fall to the ground after trying to impress a barmaid. These people were content with their little lives at least, for now. He liked Wintrel though, the people here were simple and the nation was generally free of conflict. The layout of the kingdom’s city was fortified and powerful, despite their weakness as a nation he knew the strategic defense they had repelled attackers thus far. He might stay a little longer, he needed a break. He absently broke off another piece of stale bread to chew on. For a nation that grew wheat it was pathetic for this tavern to serve anything besides the freshest of fare, he dropped the bread back in the small basket and pushed it away from him. He would have to find another place to set up and drink. A small man weaseled his way through the crowd and entered in Riv’s little nook where he sat. The man was clearly poor, his ragged clothing and unwashed face and hair stood out even in the dim smothered light of the pub. “Are you done with that bread sir?” He had his hands behind his back in a very servantly posture. This man clearly didn’t work here and was apparently resigning himself to taking unwanted food from others instead of paying. Riv leaned forward and pushed the bread basket towards him without a word. With no hesitation the man dove into the basket and shoved the stale bread in his mouth, chewing and swallowing chunks with barely a breath in between. This man was starved. Riv moved himself over along the bench he sat and motioned to the space to sit, “Please, if you’re gonna eat like that.” The hungry man stared at Riv for a moment like a caught rat, contemplating something. Maybe no one had shown this man any kindness for a while. He sat down hesitantly, continuing to eat the bread, only slowing down enough to get seated properly. He glanced back at Riv occasionally while he ate and dug more pieces of bread out of the basket. There wasn’t much space between them on the large bar seat, close enough that he could smell the grime off of the man’s clothes. Riv grimaced but remained where he was. “What’s your name stranger?” Riv had to speak loudly over the noise of the room. Taking a moment to swallow the last piece the man turned and reached out a dirt stained hand, the tips of fingernails dark with filth. “The name’s Pavel.” Riv was happy for once that he was wearing gloves. Before Riv could shake the man’s hand Pavel instead pointed at Riv’s drink, “You mind?” He cleared his throat, his shallow attempt at showing how parched he was. “Uh, go for it kid.” Riv slid the drink over to him. It only took a few seconds for Pavel to gulp the whole thing down. “So, whe-” Before Riv could finish asking anything Pavel stood up and patted his coat, a smile across his face. “Thank you for the meal sir but I best be on my way.” He turned to leave but stood a moment, the crowd shifting in front of him. He glanced back and then shuffled forward, lost in the sea of people.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0081/>0081</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-05-07</p><br></h2><p>2022-05-07
Riv couldn’t help but chuckle at the interaction, the man took advantage of him and his generosity but he didn’t mind. If someone was that desperate for food then so be it. It was the boldness of the fellow that stood out to him. He leaned back in his chair again going back to watch the groups shout and raise glasses to celebrate. You would think a province that focuses on food would be able to feed their own. Another disappointment. He caught the attention of a passing barmaid and she scuttled over. “Another ale please.” He dug around in his pocket for his money pouch. He couldn’t find it. He switched pockets, searching through all, patting his coat. He didn’t have it. He slammed the table startling the barmaid, she winced. He stood up, face red, scanning the crowd, the thief would be gone by now surely. He slammed the table again out of anger and went off into the night, resolute to find the thief named Pavel.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0082/>0082</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-05-11</p><br></h2><p>2022-05-11

I have started making conversation with one of the guards. He often stays quiet or tells me to shut up but sometimes I've gotten him to respond. Every ounce of humanity he sees in me will be helpful. I don't know his name although I refer to him as Drag because of the medieval looking dragon tattoo on his neck. He seems to not mind the name.

King Tem lifted the letter off his desk, regarding it with a level of seriousness he hadn’t held in quite some time. The parchment was stained with careful penmanship, beautiful if it had not been a threat. An assassination warning. From the assassin. The king sneered, the threat was written with a level of bravado that insinuated the killer was looking for a challenge. What an audacious move. Yet the intent was working, it did instill fear in Tem as he read it and reread it again and again. He knew this wasn’t hollow boasting, this was a professional who had never been humbled. Maybe for good reason. His small kingdom was secure from armies, it could withstand long standing sieges with its fortified structure and agricultural prowess and yet Wintrel’s large scale defensive ability from outside its walls was soured by its almost startling incapacity to protect from within. The city played on a gambit that hadn’t been challenged for generations and this assassin knew it. The king frowned, crinkling the edges of the paper as his fingers squeezed with frustration. But why? Why choose him? The grand level politics of neighboring kingdoms and provinces never concerned him, he had stayed out of their games. Was that enough of a reason? If you don’t play their games do you lose anyway? No. He knew. This wasn’t a petty game played by an overreaching lord, this was something deeper. It was an evil he had done his best to suppress, this was payment he incurred from doing so. After all these years the Divide finally caught up to him. Tem cursed and stood up, pacing across the floor of his chamber, back and forth, thinking. What could he hope to do? If this attempt on his life came to pass he would surely succumb to it. The kingdom didn’t employ any Pulsers inside its walls, there was never a need for such offensive magin power here. Hope seemed fleeting. He stopped at the lone window in the room, catching a glimpse of his magnificent city sprawling out before him, grand walls surrounding the edges hugging the kingdom in on itself, larger fields sitting beyond it stretching into the horizon. This was the first step of some larger play looming overhead. Whatever these people, his citizens, were subjected to after his death would surely be ruinous. Whatever was coming would be their end. He couldn’t protect them anymore.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0086/>0086</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-05-27</p><br></h2><p>2022-05-27
With my hand stretched out I can feel the drops of rain slowly dripping off the edge of the roof. The bars on my window restrict me but how bad can it be when I can feel the cool air, the morning crispness. Life here hasn't been fulfilling but it has taught me a lot. It taught me that I will never be willing to let myself go through imprisonment again. The pieces are set, all I can do now is hold my breath and wait until it's time. Escape should be easy. Once I'm free I'll write to you again. -Excerpt from journal, page 80.

The night was as silent as any but it still left Rallyn feeling anxious. Would the assassin be here tonight? Tomorrow? She rubbed her gloved hands together, fighting off the piercing chill. Tonight King Tem had ordered a feast in the castle knowing an assassin was lurking about in wait. Rallyn thought it was a bait of some sort by the old king, he was admittedly crafty. Must have had some tricks up his sleeve to have survived this long on that throne after all. Whatever his plan was, Rallyn’s plan was to stand here safely. She knew the truth about herself, she was afraid. She didn’t want to find an unnamed murderer that was bold enough to threaten a monarch, she wanted to live another day. She found she was starting to ask herself the tough questions. If I saw the killer would I even do anything to stop him? She sighed, pretty sure she knew the answer. She wasn’t brave like her sister Cel, a true warrior, a champion alongside a Magin user. She tightened her jaw. Why did she always have to compare herself to her? She looked down at her own hands, simple leather gloves with three black lines on each wrist, the marks of a royal guard. These were the hands of someone capable right? These thoughts turned her attention to the feel of the light armor she wore, she was aware of the touch of chainmail and leathers against her skin, she could feel the weight of the sheath on her side holding her prized shortsword. She stood for a moment, looking around in the stillness of night then slipped her sword out into the torch light. Light seemed to almost be absorbed into the black metal, reflected in an almost oily prismatic way along the edges, dark alloy. Her blade had a name as all dark alloy weapons did, Nightglow. She didn’t name the old sword, it was one that was passed down with it. When you held it you seemed to know the name to be true somehow, like a memory you had unlocked. Runes ran down the length of the dark blade, symbols etched that told a tale. ‘The champion of the moon fights with the power of her star.’ She regarded Nightglow for a moment longer before sliding it back in her sheath. She never really understood why her sword was engraved with that saying. She had long pondered it but couldn’t really grasp what it meant or why she should be the one to have it. She, the cowardly dueler wielding a legendary dark alloy blade. One could maybe translate the meaning as humanity always finds a reason to fight, for someone, or together. She didn’t really know. Why did anyone fight anyway? Why did she? She shuffled in place, suddenly feeling uncomfortable. Why DID she fight? Why was she here standing outside a king’s castle supposedly ready to engage a trained killer? She enjoyed the blade, the art of it anyway. But did she enjoy hurting? No. And she certainly didn’t enjoy being hurt either. Why did swordplay have to be so woven in with the painful and brutal side of humanity. It’s such a graceful and beautiful art, why does it have to kill? Rallyn tried to push away the thoughts. As uneventful as these nights usually were, someone else’s life could be in her hands. At the very least she should be attentive enough to alert the other more capable guards if she saw anything right? She could help in her own way. She gripped the hilt of Nightglow again, a comfortable touch. What a waste she was to this blade. Cel should have it, she WAS the warrior after all. She loosened her grip now feeling shame to even touch the weapon at all but didn’t remove her hand. She caught her mind drifting again, why couldn’t she just focus? Why has she been lately so consumed with thoughts of her own inadequacy? What merit do those invasive ideas even have on her? She is accomplished with the blade, wielder of a dark alloy, a royal guard, a killer- What?<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0088/>0088</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-05-31</p><br></h2><p>2022-05-31
She blinked and found herself standing over a man on the ground lying in a puddle of blood. She was holding Nightglow, the blade was radiating a cloud of dark air, blood dripping off the edge into the crimson pool forming around the man below her. He was wearing white though it was hard to tell, most everything was stained red. A patch on his shoulder held an emblem made of three triangles overlaid, each slighter higher placed than the last, pointing upward. She blinked again and found herself back in front of the castle, Nightglow held in her hand as it had been in the vision. She dropped the blade, letting it fall, and stumbled back against the wall behind her, sliding to the ground. She had never seen the contents of that vision before. She couldn’t comprehend what she just experienced. Confusion and fear taking hold she just closed her eyes and wept, the image of a dead man now burned into her mind.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0089/>0089</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-06-01</p><br></h2><p>2022-06-01
The feast was wonderful. A long banquet table piled with a vast assortment of trays and plates of the province’s finest food and drink filled the hall. Servants passing through doorways set into the long side of the room were taking empty plates and replacing them with full ones, extravagant meals piled high. A seemingly endless array to choose from, breathtaking. The hall itself wasn’t the grandest but it bore subtleties of luxury, the colored tapestries made of fine silks, the table itself was Gnawood, even the plates were shaped and polished from silvear bones.
Riv poked at a baked pheasant with his fork idly as he watched the flow of the room, working like a well oiled machine. Even the fork was intricately cut silvear bone, he twirled it in his fingers and went for another bite. The bird was delicious by way of standards of course but it was coated in rich sauces and spices that he couldn’t quite stomach, he tried washing away the taste with a few sips of ale. He moved that plate aside and opted for one with a colorful looking bread. A servant swept up his discarded dish only moments after pushing it away.
He could hear the king talking across the table a few seats over to a group of what looked like merchant leaders. The tradesmasters always donned those bright colored vests and chains, some fashion he didn’t understand. Why make things complicated? He could hear mentions of trade routes to Paranel but he didn’t care enough to hold focus to it. That’s not why he was here. He would wait.
He tore a piece off the loaf, inspecting the colors that swirled through the middle of the bread, red and brown. Sweet looking spice dusted the top of the bread, a pleasant looking roll. Where were breads like this in the rest of Wintrel? The kingdom, for all of its farming aptitude, still produced mediocre food in the local taverns. But this roll screamed decadence.
“Lord Rivinwell, I hope you know the food isn’t poisoned.”
Riv looked up to see the king himself had moved directly across from him, watching him inspect the bread with a smile. “Please.” He lowered the bread back to the plate. “Riv.”
“Very well. Riv.” The king said, nodding at his request. “I too am much fonder of the shortened names these days, Temerel is such a bother to say.” He smiled again. “I appreciate your presence at tonight’s feast.”
“Don’t appreciate it too much, I haven’t yet told you why I’m actually here. You might find yourself disappointed by the details.”
Tem raised an eyebrow, prompting Riv to continue but he instead turned away and picked the bread back up, starting to pick at it. “Pulse,” Tem spoke amusedly, “is a place that I find breeds the most interesting of people.”
“I could say the same for the rest of the world.” Riv grunted, mouthful of bread, glancing around the hall. “But an existence without magin doesn’t sound too interesting to me.”
“You’ll have to excuse the rest of the world for our dullness then, a malady we’ve learned to live with.” The king seemed to have a permanent smirk. “If not the invitation to my kingdom, what has pulled you to the edge of the world to sit at my table?”
“There was a blacksmith,” Riv began, “who had the finest tools and the finest of hands. A master at her trade. She would forge blades and thrones for kings, a gift she possessed like no other to form such alloys and metals into weapons of divinity. She was an artist of force.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0090/>0090</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-06-01</p><br></h2><p>2022-06-01
Riv pulled another one of the bone plates holding the swirly colorful bread closer to him after finishing his first small loaf. “At dusk one night the blacksmith received word that her own daughter was trapped in the kingdom’s castle. Her daughter, you see, had made friends with the little prince, a devious and malicious little boy. He locked her in a dungeon room and had thrown away the key. When our smith got to the keep she found what she had feared most, that the message was true. Her precious daughter locked away behind a mountain of steel, one as fate would have it, that she herself had forged.” Riv pointed at the king with a tear of bread in his hand, “I know you aren’t a father Tem, but surely you understand that no storm could come between you and your own child.”
Tem nodded, “Of course.” “And in our story so did the king, protecting his son.” The king for the first time dropped his smile and frowned in understanding frustration. “The king forbade anyone from interfering with the cell except the blacksmith herself. He didn’t want it getting out that his son, heir to the throne, was a little demon. He couldn’t usurp him before he had even hit manhood. So our smith worked to save her own. She used hammers, axes, swords, bent-steel rods all to no avail. Her craftsmanship of a dungeon chamber was simply too fine. There was one flaw in her design though, the lock on the door itself, the only piece she didn’t make. She was no locksmith, so she had to use caution. If she were to break and jam the lock her child would die in that room, dungeon cell sealed forever. The smith started work on lockpicks but this was one area she had never delved into with her profession. She created works on a large scale, built to destroy, made to last, not flimsy picks. And flimsy they were, they all broke upon entering the keyhole. This was a powerful lock my friend, one imbued with magin. Simple steel was destroyed, the key must have been made from a powerful alloy.” Riv waved down a passing servant and pointed at the bit of remaining bread he had left, and nodded with a smile. He turned back to Tem, “But she was a master. She herself owned a legendary dark alloy blade, Tendril was its name. And in her resolve to save her own child she destroyed the sword.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0091/>0091</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-06-01</p><br></h2><p>2022-06-01
The king seemed confused, his brow furrowed. “I.. don’t understand.. destroying dark alloy? Is that not an impossible feat?”
“Passion leads us to do impossible things, Tem. When only an impossibility stands in your way of what you desire most, it’s merely a step away.” Riv had found a small dish of orange butter and was now spreading it on a slice with a bone knife. “She split Tendril into two equal halves. The Heart of Tendril and The Soul of Tendril. The new swords were thin enough such that they could enter in the keyhole of the enormous cell door. One blade to put pressure on the turning mechanism, another to push up the pins.” A servant delivered two fresh plates of the swirled red bread in front of Riv which he accepted graciously, slathering one of the loaves with the orange butter. “Our blacksmith opened the door.” Riv’s eyes met the king’s. “And she found her daughter already dead. The boy had murdered her daughter and in a desperate attempt to cover his wrong doing had locked her body in the cell, a room he thought no one would be able to open.” He continued to eat his bread in silence, signaling the end to the story. The king took a moment to consider what he had been told. If he had any questions about the epilogue of this story he did not ask them, he understood that nothing would have happened to the little prince. “Is that story real?” Riv shrugged, “Is it?” He glared back. The king met his eyes. He spoke softly, “Do you know of what is to come Lord Rivinwell?”
“...Yes. This kingdom, your kingdom, as defensible as it is, is already dead at the heart, no matter the tools you employ.” Tem sighed, “So then I must ask again, why have you come?” “The Divide is weakening and I understand the burden you carry and the sacrifice you gave to the world but the world is changing King Temerel and I cannot save you from it.” Riv stood, resting his palms on the table. “But I will try.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0092/>0092</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-06-02</p><br></h2><p>2022-06-02

Riv kicked at a dead pheasant, the creature was missing feathers and patches of skin, likely a sickness was the killer. Though out here it was hard to tell. No scavengers had gotten to it yet which was a surprise. He glanced back at the two guardsmen that accompanied him in the darkness. The king had thought it was wise to not have their only Pulser in the kingdom sent out alone past the Divide without backup. For all that the king was intelligent, he was also ignorant. How much did the man really know about Riv’s people? He squinted through the shadows around himself, he felt almost blind and incapacitated in the low light level. This would definitely take some getting used to after living with light for so long.
Out here past the Divide everything was dark, an eternal umbra an unchanging level of dusk that remained throughout the days and nights. Looking up into the sky you could make out the dim gray disks of the sun and moons. Life here didn’t exist the same way it did on the other side. The darkness seemed to permeate through everything, the flora grew in sickly desperate strains, no real light to feed it properly. The animals who survived off the unsubstantial flora grew equally as twisted and diseased, the effect winding up the food chain.
Though their group had only traveled a half hour through the darkness it seemed like another world entirely, even a few steps past the Divide would grant the same effect. Riv could see the expressions of the two people with him barely through the thick shade. They clearly had never set foot on this side had they? The taller guardsman, Kedrel, who wore the silvery steel plate seemed to grip his heavy blade like someone would take it from him. He would jump at his own shadow if there were any in the darkness. Oddly enough he didn’t wear a helmet that matched his set of plate, an odd choice, he instead wore a brown cloth he had tied around the top of his head.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0094/>0094</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-06-04</p><br></h2><p>2022-06-04
The shorter one, Rallyn, was of more interest to Riv, there was a sense of competence and experience that she held in an air about herself. Though she still seemed concerned she didn’t seem scared. She wore chainmail and hardened leather, marked with the insignias of the royal guards of Wintrel, a simple three lines. Riv smiled at the notion that someone would be smart enough to be lighter on their feet out here. The detail that interested him though was that of her sword, an unbelievable and legendary relic of time’s past, a dark alloy blade. One didn’t simply gloss over something like that. A wielder of dark alloy was someone that commanded your immediate respect, such a sought after and fought after prize, only the most capable seemed to ever carry them. Riv found himself hoping to witness her in battle, it was an opportunity to behold, seeing a dark alloy user practice their art.
“Um, sir?” Kedrel had stopped looking over his own shoulder for a moment long enough to address Riv. “Why can’t we just light a torch?” The question had probably been bothering him for the last half hour hiking through the pervasive gloom.
Riv shrugged, “Do it.”
Kedrel raised an eyebrow at the answer, but dropped his pack to the ground and walked a short distance away to look for wood to start a fire. Rallyn looked to Riv, questioning look on her face. “Surely there’s a reason why? Right?”
“You’ll see.”
Kedrel came back to the group with a thick and twisted branch which he set on the ground to search through his pack for a rag. Rallyn kept eyeing Riv, he could see her out of the corner of his eye, searching him for answers. Such a skeptical one. He glared contentedly at the tall soldier fumbling with the makeshift torch. After what seemed too long Kedrel finally had the torch wrapped and ready, setting it alight. Immediately it was clear what was wrong. The fire gave off no light itself. Like the sun above it was gray and muted and did not interact with the air around it. The shade of the air around it stayed its distinct umbral, no darker, no lighter.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0095/>0095</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-06-04</p><br></h2><p>2022-06-04
Without a word Riv started walking again, his lesson finished. He could hear Kedrel grumble and stomp out the torch behind. Rallyn caught up with him quickly, her eyes forward. “Sir.. how much do you know about this place?”
“Enough to know we shouldn’t be here.” Riv kept his stride steady. He could hear Kedrel finally fall into pace behind him. “We can’t be here. The darkness doesn’t allow it.”
“Okay.. well as cryptic and vague as that is, it doesn't really answer my question.” She sounded frustrated almost. “Ask a better one then.” He could hear Rallyn sigh, “What is the darkness? What causes the Divide? We’ve been told stories and heard legends about it our entire lives but..” She trailed off. But their lives were short. What could you even say to someone so young? Anyone who wasn’t Pulse just hadn’t yet and wouldn’t ever live long enough to know the truth about the world, to see it with their own eyes and understand. It would always be a memory out of reach to them, locked away in their folktales and campfire songs. What could you say to make someone understand the truth of what hid behind this awful pervasive darkness? That awful shattering truth of why this world was being hidden away? Perhaps he should tell her just that, but he understood the frustration of hearing such things, that things are just out of reach for you. Riv turned to Rallyn, “Have you heard the tale of Fin the hunter?” “Uh, no..” “Well, it starts off as most tales do, with someone capable. Our such someone was named Fin, a master hunter and trapper.” Riv reached into the side of his pack and pulled out a bundle of something. “And Fin was dying.” He unwrapped the bundle, a small loaf of the swirly bread from Wintrel’s castle baker.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0096/>0096</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-06-07</p><br></h2><p>2022-06-07
King Tem worked his way along the main city road of Wintrel, polished cobblestones passing underneath him in a set of ornate patterns. He was fond of the roads and thoroughfares in his kingdom, the detail, the structure. How could you ever have a proper functioning city without strong roads to carry horses and wagons? To carry the people? Inspire even the beggars by the road they walk upon.
He looked about himself, seeing the crowds shift and flow up and down the street. The ignorance of the masses. He pulled up his hood and continued on. His disguise, in his opinion, wasn’t very well put together, a simple brown robe tied off at the waist with a length of rope, gray trousers underneath along with simple sandals. He tried to rough up the fabric a bit, hoping the frays of the cloth would feel more natural. He even went out to his gardens and rubbed his face and clothes with a little dirt. Grime would help. But he still felt himself walking as a king, the natural posture and authority he had been so accustomed to. He winced every time he caught himself walking straight backed, what a fool.
He had been advised very harshly against making the trip down from his keep but he wasn’t worried. If the assassin comes for him in the midst of his own people then so be it. He felt like an animal with its leg caught in a trap, just immobilized and waiting for the end. No, he wanted to get out and walk, to see. Was this truly any riskier than staying in the trap waiting for the hunter? He liked to think it wasn’t. His new Pulser and best guards had been sent away for a few hours anyway, no sense in sitting and waiting for his death in his own home alone.
He found himself thinking about Riv, Pulsers weren’t exactly the easiest people to understand. So many secrets they always carried about them and this one was no different. How had Riv known so much? About him, the Divide, his kingdom’s fate. People passed by Tem and he thought he could see them glancing at him. Was that in his head? He pulled his hood up tighter to shadow more of his face.
The Pulser had insisted he go beyond the Divide a short distance to investigate some suspicions he had, he didn’t share more than that but still accepted the company of two others with him after some insistence. Curious. The man had good timing though, good presence of where to be. Tem didn’t think Riv was the assassin, he knew he could’ve been killed countless times already since his arrival here in Wintrel. There was an air about Riv, though rough and mysterious – even frustratingly at some points – that was honest. And bless the stars he was grateful, to have a Pulser in your midst and on your side was a blessing indeed.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0097/>0097</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-06-07</p><br></h2><p>2022-06-07
Tem stopped along the road to observe a sign for a leather workers shop, inside its windows you could see mannequins dressed with various types of armor. He looked back down the street a ways to see that his guard was still following from a distance, they weren’t in as ridiculous of a costume by comparison, they fit in with the crowd well even with the sword at their side.They shared a nod and Tem lethargically moved away from the storefront feigning disinterest, continuing again down the street. He had to admit something to himself before hiking down from the palace, his kingdom wasn’t always the safest place to be in recent times. He could feel an anxiety in the air as he walked through it, like a glass at the edge of the table, he felt like something was moments away from shattering.
Riv had spoken about those things hadn’t he? Had the Divide failed so soon?
Someone bumped into the side of the king throwing him off balance, he stumbled but didn’t fall. By the time he composed himself and looked for the person they were lost in the crowds. He pulled his hood back up and continued on, a little more wary of his surroundings. Making a scene would be highly unfortunate. He kept his head forward, looking around and acting suspicious makes you suspicious.
He turned into an alley and found an unlabeled iron door. He looked back to the entrance of the alley that he had walked in from seeing his guard lean against the wall there, hat down over his eyes. Tem turned back to the door, and reached to knock. His heartbeat quickened, and he found himself sweating. Thump. Tem pulled his hand away from the door, he hadn’t yet knocked. He looked to the alley entrance, his guard slumped over on the ground, blood spilling over the polished stones from a knife in his neck. Tem reached for the door handle, throwing the door open, and hurrying inside.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0098/>0098</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-06-09</p><br></h2><p>2022-06-09

It's been a long time. Too long in fact. This universe has not been kind to me. I've been hunted as I walk into the trap laid out before me. It hasn't been safe to communicate.

“Do you know where you are?”
The question was simple. It was short. Brint knew that much. Why was he having such trouble understanding? His eyes were losing focus.
“Do you know who you are?”
Brint blinked. “Brint.”
“Hm.” The man wrote something down. “What do you remember last?”
Brint sat for a time in silence, thinking, trying to think. His brow furrowed in concentration. He couldn’t understand the question. His head was starting to ache worse than before, he closed his eyes in frustration. He could hear a sigh from the man in front of him, followed by more scribbling.
“Who is Brint?”
Brint’s eyes opened, he understood. “Brint is Brint.” He said it matter-of-factly. Why didn’t this man understand? Why couldn’t they understand each other?
The man scratched his head and wrote more things down before turning and walking away. Brint wanted to reach out, he wanted to yell out, the words and actions wouldn’t form. He didn’t want to be alone again in the dark. The man walked out through the light filled doorway, a moment later the door slid into place, locking Brint away again in pure darkness.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0104/>0104</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-09-25</p><br></h2><p>2022-09-25
Nym felt he was close, so very close to understanding. The secrets felt beyond his grasp, beyond comprehension. But he was close. The pieces had been handed to him, but he couldn’t understand how they fit. Was something missing?
He paced around his writing desk — it had been hours — trying to draw connections together within his mind. Questions spinning, focus starting to dissipate, he sat down, defeated. Why had he been given the ability to only barely brush the edge of something grander in understanding? Why had he been given so much, so much, to only see how little he had? It was beyond frustrating.
He cursed the Gods quietly. If not to help him and his people then what was his purpose? Why push him down a path so far just to close it off and send him back? Was his existence a game? Was he merely a plaything to those beings?

Seven days. Fin had seven days left to live. He stopped for a moment, appreciating the soft breeze he felt across his face, how it swept through the trees, rustling all the leaves in a soft and beautiful way. To feel, to be alive. What did that mean? These trees were supposedly as alive as he was, do they too fear death? He buried these questions away and continued trudging forward. No point in thinking about death. No time. The cure is out there, so he was told. The heart of a rothswip, a mythical creature known for its immunities. Should it be real, should he find one, Fin would live.

Rothswips by legend were very small rodent creatures, white in color, large ears, and that fabled elastic tail, a tail long enough such that when coiled could push the creature vast distances, not unlike a spring. Other campfire stories said they also fly and talk. Fin knew restraint when it came to believing every little story, nuggets of truth were hidden in each exaggeration but most things were just lies. Just like its cure-all heart might be. He tried forcing himself to think about something else. There wasn’t enough time to be doubting this far in. He leafed through his notebook as he walked through the woods, he’d collected several drawings of the creature from old books and sketches from supposed witnesses. The past few weeks the desperation had kicked in enough to chase down fairy tales like these. He had doubted or had evidence that the stories of the finwinch, the deities of Fenrel forest, and the reapers were falsified or just children’s tales. So that left the rothswip. Research had led him down this path, all he could do was hope it wasn’t a dead end.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0108/>0108</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-10-02</p><br></h2><p>2022-10-02
Fin was a master hunter, he understood the forests more so perhaps than many of the creatures that lived in them, his whole life dedicated to the craft. There was a certain gift he had, whether it be an extreme eye for detail or a very accurate and high focus memory, he used it for tracking, and he did it extremely well. He could point out breaks in twigs and leaves, the outlines of the tracks of animals in the dirt, he saw the paths clearly, he could envision how animals walked through each area, how they interacted with the environment just upon seeing it. This induced paranoia to some degree. If he could see it surely others could too? Someone could follow him quite easily, as he could others. Constantly he would double back, switch paths, and cross up and down waterways as much as he could to dissuade theoretical pursuers. He wasn’t sure if he honestly believed someone was ever following him, but he liked to be certain no one had the chance. This however usually made progress slow during expeditions, time that would be going to waste. So as Fin traveled further north he found himself letting go of his old restrictive habits, it only made him more nervous. He had to bring up the point that it didn’t matter at the end if he was dead, too slow to find anything substantial enough to save his life, so on he pushed with more than fears of death crowding his mind.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0109/>0109</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-10-07</p><br></h2><p>2022-10-07

Another night of fog. Wonderful. Perin sat on the high outer walls of Wintrel, legs dangling down over the streets below. It truly was a wonderful city, all things considered. Even through the middle of the night he could see people far beneath walking the cobbled roads, lights of taverns and shops illuminating the darkness, the sounds of carriage wheels rolling and grinding over paved stones. This kingdom never seemed to sleep. And yet, Wintrel seemed as if its eyes were never truly open to the happenings around it. There was so much to know. Perin opened his little notebook and flitted through pages until he found an empty one and waited. Deep red colored words began scrawling themselves into the page on their own. ‘The pulser has passed the divide’ Perin sighed, “You’d think a deity such as yourself would have better tools at their disposal to deal with such things.” The page remained as it was. “Well okay then, no room for that I suppose.” Perin stood atop the wall and turned away from the city to the forest covering the east. In the pervasive fog he could only see the edge of the trees, but he knew the woods sprawled out past the horizon, as far as one could see in an endless darkness. He closed the little notebook with a snap and pocketed it, “I really should receive more gratitude, I’d imagine other gods would respect their assassins a little more.” With that, Perin dropped off the wall into the darkness below.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0111/>0111</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-11-03</p><br></h2><p>2022-11-03
A sharp snap of wood made Fin twirl, knife at the ready. Nothing. He couldn’t see anyone or anything but trees with faded trunks and wild growths of brush around him. He swallowed, looking about himself quickly, what was that? Where was the break? His eyes scanned the ground, darting everywhere, he remembered the direction the snap came from, but still saw nothing, no signs, no tracks, this area was too overgrown, too thick. Fin once again swiveled around, checking about himself, brandishing the blade. He felt surrounded, without information it’s easy to feel suffocated, as if even the trees were moving in on him, ready to strike. If you didn’t know where your pursuer was then you could assume they were everywhere. Fin kept turning himself in circles, surveying his flanks. Uneasy, he turned back towards the original source, straining his senses to pick up on anything, but failing to do so. Should he run? Would he run into a trap? Was he already in one? He gripped the knife harder in frustration, sweat beading down his temples, heart thumping in his ears. Another crack. Fin swung the knife and pointed the tip in the direction of the sound, startling a small mink. He and the animal locked eyes a moment before it scampered away into the brush. Fin remained standing, his arm still extended, holding the knife and breathing heavily. Just a little rodent. Nothing more. He resheathed his hunters knife, trying to calm the thunder of his own heartbeat. It was obvious to even him he was paranoid, but he didn’t realize how on edge he had become. If it was real danger, he reacted quickly, but it wasn’t. He should’ve realized that sooner. He was losing his edge. He sat down on the ground for a moment, collecting his thoughts, looking for composure. The earth below him had started to drain its color the further he pushed north. He felt the dirt below him, instead of deep browns it now resembled a muted gray beige. Everything here around him felt washed out, only hints of the original hues remained. He had heard rumors of the grove ahead. It was all so peculiar though, to be seeing it first hand. If he was going to die in a few days, shouldn’t he find time to appreciate this place of wonder? He stood up brushing the grayish soil off his pants and continued trudging on. He would maybe enjoy it as a man without a clock hanging over his head, but not now.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0112/>0112</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-11-11</p><br></h2><p>2022-11-11

I sat in orbit for a while, thinking. Studying Fifteen, the way the planet moved, the way its colors swirled as it slowly spun around its star. I hadn’t received communication since the last nor had I sensed where the pursuer could be. For these moments things were still. Not peaceful, but quiet. A beeping on the scanners drew my attention. A new object had entered the system.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0114/>0114</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-11-15</p><br></h2><p>2022-11-15
Pavel jolted awake, a loud sound ripped him from sleep. He looked around in the darkness, just a sliver of light hanging above. He shifted around slightly, pieces of trash crumpling around him. He had slept in a trash bin again, he thought this alley was safe enough for the day. Maybe it wasn’t. He stared at the bin door above, had someone opened it? Was the sound he heard someone closing the heavy door again after discovering his hiding place? His heart started racing, if someone knew he was here that would mean trouble for him. He started, reaching for his pack buried in the corner, and sat up within the spacious bin, crouched, patting all of his pockets making sure he had everything he needed before he left. Pavel slowly pushed up the door just an inch to peer out into the light. For a few moments it was hard to see anything, the brightness was blinding. He blinked a few times before he was able to make out the scene in front of him. A dead man at the mouth to the alleyway lay pooled in his own blood, slumped against the wall. Pavel dropped the door immediately, sitting crouched in the darkness. Panic flooded his mind. Had anyone seen him? What if the killer is still here? Is he safe here? After a deep breath Pavel fished around in his pack slowly for the little knife he had, resolute to make as little sound as possible. Finally finding the thing buried deep he pulled out the small blade, still sheathed in rough, scratchy leather. He never had to use this before. He hoped he still didn’t have to. He gripped the hilt and stripped the sheath off, his little dagger reflecting the small beam of light that filtered in through the seam in the door above him. Pavel was no brave warrior, he was a coward. He decided quickly waiting in his hiding place would be the best course of action. He didn’t know how active things were out there, the last thing he wanted was to get involved. But how long until someone discovers the body and investigators search the surrounding area? He cursed to himself, he was really stuck in an impossible situation wasn’t he? All he wanted to do was to disappear. He pushed his ear towards the thin opening, if someone was out there he wanted to know. Eventually a scream, he guessed someone finally found the body. Quietly cursing to himself he lifted the lid an inch to peek out again, barely seeing someone’s heel pass out of sight of the alley. They were going to notify the guards. Pavel swore and leaped out of the trash bin, stumbling on the landing. He just had to get out of here. Pavel had only taken a few steps forward before someone appeared near the entrance. They called out and pointed at him, “The killer is here!” Pavel realized he was still holding the knife in his hand, he swore loudly, looking about, begging to himself, “Please be a way out, please.” An unlabeled iron door stood sunken into the stone wall of the alley, one he hadn’t noticed last night on the way in. Without hesitation Pavel lunged for the handle and threw himself inside, still hearing the shouts behind him, the yells calling after him as the killer.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0115/>0115</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-11-19</p><br></h2><p>2022-11-19
Fin stoked the fire, watching little wisps and embers float up and vanish. Soon he would join those embers and be gone to the world. He lost himself staring into the blaze for some time, reminding himself that his clock was running out. He knew he needed to rest but it was a painful acknowledgement all the same. With so little time left, why did he have to spend so much of it in rest, in sleep, and in sating his hunger? He found it ironic in some way, the less time he had the less he wanted to spend it doing what it took to simply live. Usually he wouldn’t let a fire burn this long either, they acted as beacons in the night, and people were attracted to such things. He no longer wanted to let his paranoia rule him though. After drawing his weapon in response to a simple mink, he decided his on edge attitude would only prove to slow him down, something he couldn’t afford. Unfortunately he felt his hand was forced in wasting time to rest, auditory hallucinations that started infrequently were now all but common. His mind was slowed, certain connections weren’t forming and it was causing frustration. Sleep be damned, but he needed it.
“I appreciate the fire.”
Fin didn’t bother looking around. The hallucinations were becoming stronger. At first he was able to hear the beginning of someone speaking, maybe sounds, but they would cut off sharply and fade back into his mind. He was sometimes able to tell real from imaginary by how the noise faded. But now they were full sentences.
“Hard of hearing?”
This time Fin did raise his head, seeing a strange looking man sitting on the opposite side of the fire from him, warming his hands.
“Ah, maybe just didn’t hear me the first time.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0116/>0116</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-11-26</p><br></h2><p>2022-11-26
Fin, now standing, pointed his knife at the strange man, the fire still blazing and crackling between them. The stranger still sat, warming the palms of his hands on the fire. He looked up at Fin with an almost humorous expression. “Sit down son, I’m too tired for that.” He shivered, “And cold.” He turned his expression away from Fin and back to the fire, enjoying its warmth. He had long messy and tangled brown hair and wore very simple garb, dark gray, almost robe-like. Strong features that looked so calm as he just stared content at the fire.
Was this man here to hurt Fin? His immediate instincts said yes, but then they always said yes. “Who are you?” He blurted out, he gripped the handle a little tighter.
The stranger's eyes flicked back up to Fin, he looked almost surprised he was still holding him at knifepoint. “Friend, I’m someone who’s just a little chilled out here in the woods and could use a fire.” He raised his eyebrows, looking at his blade, “And someone who could use less of that.”
Dealing with people, especially strangers, wasn’t Fin’s speciality. He knew that. He always preferred the woods, the woods made sense. Animals made sense. Plants made sense. Everything was wired a certain way, he could figure it out, the way things worked out here, the food chain, the ecosystems. But people were another story, they were complex, they did things that didn’t make sense. Every person was so different, so hard to understand. They said things they didn’t mean, did things to cause pain. People hurt him.
His mind worked to assess this stranger, most immediate conclusions screamed this man was dangerous, that this man had been following him. He felt that nagging sensation though, the optimistic person within himself asking if he was really just threatening a man who came to him to share some heat and some safety from the environment. He did not lower the knife however. Not until he was decided. “What are you doing out here?”
“I could ask you the same, friend. The grove here isn’t too keen on accepting travelers.” The strangers' eyes looked around the both of them, from the canopy that sat above to the thick trunks of trees and brush that riddled the area. All gray and colorless. “The grove is a wondrous place, friend. But that doesn’t mean it’s welcoming.” His eyes returned to the fire. “Lord knows I clearly haven’t been shown any welcoming spirit.” He chuckled.
Fin swallowed, eyes still locked on the man before him. This stranger only gave him more questions, in both answers and directly. He looked at the knife in his hand. “I’m sorry about that.” Why did he apologize?
“It’s okay, we all get jumpy out alone in the forests sometimes now don’t we?” The stranger said, he smiled at Fin despite the knife in his hand.
Fin didn’t have long until he would die, he didn’t know how long he had been awake either. A few days ago it had been a week until his clock would run out, today though, he couldn’t tell how long those ‘few days’ had been. He was losing track of time, it could be any day, any moment, that he would simply fall over and die. It wasn’t lost on him that he didn’t have to do it alone. Honestly, he preferred it that way, but facts remained, without taking risks he realized he probably wouldn’t make it. Was trusting this stranger a risk he would take? He was tired, lost, and not in any position to continue as he had. Sleep. He needed it. Badly. How, though, could he now sleep knowing that there were people around? How could he sleep knowing this man specifically was around? The options were clear to Fin, before he could sleep he needed to make a choice. Either trust this man or be rid of him.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0117/>0117</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-12-01</p><br></h2><p>2022-12-01
Rel held the silver platter steady, several ivory plates and cups stacked high, each containing the finest delicacies the kingdom had to offer. Sweet rolls spiced with exotic oils from the western provinces, skin of a barrel fish that had boiled for three days in sugared vell juice, among other tasty treats that only the richest of nobility would ever have the capacity to try. Rel stood in a line of servants, each holding their own trays proffered to king Modin, who stood bare chested, scratching his oversized gut thinking about the meals before him.
“Send a new feast, these don’t interest me.”
Sellira stepped forward, his lead assistant. “My lord, this array is filled with all the bakers have. There is no mo-”
The king waved a hand dismissively and began walking towards his bed, “I will not repeat myself. If this is all the bakers can do, then have them exiled or killed, I don’t care which.”
Sellira gripped the sides of her note board, Rel could see the frustration and anxiety building in her face. It’s a shame the person he was here to kill wasn’t the king.
“Alright.” Sellira sighed, looking past the long line of servants, “You heard him, send these back to the kitchens.” She stared at the floor as she stalked out of the room.
She was a good person Sellira was, Rel figured she would try and find a way to donate the dishes to the local poverty instead of simply throwing them away like the king would assuredly want. He turned with the rest of the staff and began marching out of the king’s chambers into the hallways beyond. If old Modin ever found out he’d have her executed publicly, he would no doubt view it as an insult to the throne if meals that were deserving of a king were ever shared by the common people.
The level of wealth displayed within the castle was something Rel expected from someone like the king, but the shock of seeing it with his own eyes still lingered. Riches that decorated a single hallway that some smaller towns within the province would never collectively see in a hundred generations. He was not here to steal, but the voice in the back of his mind had often quietly offered such ideas, he knew that getting out of here with even the smallest of trinkets or adornments that lined the walls would set him up for a long while. His eyes remained forward as he walked however, he wasn’t here to steal, that wasn’t why he was hired. Performing the job you were hired for was above all else. He’d have time for his selfish ambitions later.
The kitchens were proportionately as massive as the rest of the castle, but here instead of the gaudy over displayed richness was a refined, clean, and methodically sound space. This was the sanctum of the lead chef, Fellren, and he liked his realms meticulously sterile and minimalistic. He stood tall in front of the serving stations, hands held behind his back – a commandeering posture – with a disappointed look on his face, no doubt at seeing all the trays return full from the king’s quarters.
Fellren called out, “Sellira! Come at once!” He remained standing where he was, disgruntled look, his eyes cast over the line of servants like they themselves were the issue and not the food.
Sellira hurried into the kitchen alongside the train of servants, bowing slightly. “Sorry my lord, but the king has requested something.. else.” She didn’t look him in the eyes, but instead at his feet. “He said these ‘didn’t interest him’.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0118/>0118</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-12-01</p><br></h2><p>2022-12-01
Fellren frowned deeply, projecting his hateful gaze onto her. Rel understood why it was easier to stare at his boots. “I swear woman, if you didn’t pitch these wondrous meals well enough..” Sellira remained in her subservient posture, his words not having an effect on her. “Bah!” Fellren raised his hands and stalked away, barking orders at the chefs and bakers under his management, Rel guessed he was looking for someone more cathartic to push his hate and frustration towards.
Sellira exhaled deeply, writing something on her notepad before scurrying out of the kitchen the way she came. Rel’s eyes narrowed, watching her go. He needed her list. In it were schedules and notes, all the inner workings of everyone’s schedules down to the minute. It would take him months to learn what he needed to without it – hundreds of people worked in this forsaken place – and he didn’t have the time. This was the fastest route, his target had to be killed before the week was up. But for now he watched her go while standing in line, gloved hands still holding a silver platter and cloche, waiting for instructions like a servant would.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0119/>0119</a><p id=dateFrmt>2022-12-08</p><br></h2><p>2022-12-08
Another day, another night, another journey, another plight. At the end of the road lies a scholar in black, And Orel's killer in white, the truth between them, lies just out of sight.

I can't tell if the beggar made up the piece or simply couldn't remember it correctly after the clear slippage of his mind. I can conclude this because the meter with which this follows is discordant and unpleasant to be frank. I can see gaps here.

Bell marched down the corridor, studying the faces that flashed through the bars. She couldn’t imagine being one of these men, locked up in a cage. Pathetic. She looked down on them as she passed each cell, each more disgusting and filthy than the last. The faces of miscreants, the faces of people who lost. She would never lose. She wouldn’t get caught. That’s the difference between her and them, she was a winner. Some silently glared back at her, most laid in their beds, ineptly staring at the ceiling of their tiny little world. It’s amazing how quickly the humanity is ripped from a person once you keep them somewhere for a little too long. The sound of her bootfalls echoing off the stone walls was not met with as much inquisition as she would’ve expected, most didn’t stir at all. These men had given up. Each of these prisoners had potential once. A pity. She could respect some of these inmates' plans, some were rather interesting, but their execution was flawed. What a waste. She stopped at the last cell in the block, a figure sat in a chair, back to her. The wall he was staring at was completely covered with arrays of scratches, the patterns of such looked to her like a language she had never seen. This one though, this one’s plans were more than interesting.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0121/>0121</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-01-16</p><br></h2><p>2023-01-16
The prisoner’s clothes were bright white and clean, they seemed like they had been pressed recently, even fitted. Odd. The institution’s uniforms looked relatively strange when taken care of and not worn down by grime of the filthy who wore them. Standing behind him it was clear his hair was combed back and styled. There was an air of order here.
“Miss Bell, I think you may have found yourself lost.”
She cleared her throat, “Your.. reputation casts a large shadow, Lez.” The prisoner didn’t respond, back still to her.
“How did you know I would come? As far as I know we’ve never met and you’ve been imprisoned here for.. a long time.”
Lez sighed and carefully lifted himself from the chair, turning as he did so. His face was clean shaven, eyes that spoke of annoyance rather than the curiosity she felt she deserved. She narrowed her eyes as he flattened his shirt and strode over to the bars, hands now behind his back.
“Your arrival here was doubted but yet you showed up all the same, I had hoped you would attend to other ventures.” Lez said, his face was hard to read, it felt expressionless.
“That didn’t answer my question.”
“I didn’t intend to answer it.” Lez said dryly.
Bell clenched her jaw, she wasn’t a fan of these games of control. Or rather, more honestly with herself, she just simply wasn’t a fan of losing them. This man was in prison, he was stuck here with the other failures, why did it feel like he had control here?
“Lez, I’ll be blunt, I’ve heard of your.. endeavors. I think we both may have an opportunity to-”
Lez turned, “I’ll stop you there Miss Bell,” and began walking towards his chair. “I told you before you were lost to come here, I had meant it.” He situated himself in his chair, back to her once more. “Good day Miss Bell.”
Her hands turned to fists at her sides. How insufferable. How am I going to get him out of here?<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0122/>0122</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-01-20</p><br></h2><p>2023-01-20
No stars were out tonight, bad sign. They say the stars were guides, without them you traveled alone. Ryn felt alone, though she trudged through the unkempt brush with her soul alight. There was a real possibility she wouldn’t have to feel empty for much longer. She could still barely glimpse the light in the distance, it looked like a small fire, far away and hard to tell, but in her mind it might as well have been a beacon shining and cutting through the night sky with the way it shone into her heart. Seeing that little speck of wavering light represented everything. It was hope.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0123/>0123</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-01-22</p><br></h2><p>2023-01-22
The sun was hot today. Wendel’s skin burned, the dry heat felt like it was searing him, a slow roast. As he walked he wondered how he would taste should he be prepared as a meal. If he was to die today anyway, which considering the scorching blaze the sun was throwing out, was indeed possible, would he be as delicious as a steak was? Could a chef work with what he had to offer? He raised up his hands, blistering in the heat, and took a look at himself. He wasn’t plump and he was sure his skin weighed more than his muscle did, he didn’t know much about butchery or animal breeders, but he knew the fat ones tasted the best, more value on those bones. Maybe he would taste like a cheap cut of meat, the ones only desperate and poor folk like himself would be willing to buy just to get even a taste of something special, something other than grain and mash. The kind that you weren’t sure if the cook just picked up off the road, some curious vermin who got a little too close to society’s bustle, a horse shoe imprint stuck in its coat. No, he wouldn’t taste that good he supposed. Not even in death could he be helpful to anyone. Not even for a meal. He lowered his head and trudged on, thoughts of food only served to torture him, even thoughts of himself as such. He didn’t know how long he had walked but he knew he had a ways ahead of him yet. He glanced up at the sky, the sun hanging there, bearing down misery upon him. He could use a hat though. That could at least make his face stop hurting, maybe take away a few of those bright sun spot afterimages that popped up every time he blinked. He tugged at his shirt a bit, could he reuse that into a hat? Was it stiff enough? He looked around himself, no trees but a few dead bushes, dry as the cracked and split ground were, sitting around doing nothing but dying. He ripped some fabric off his shirt and grabbed two twigs that he supposed were straight enough. He set the sticks to each side of his head and made them meet ahead of him, creating a triangle with his forehead, and used that as a guide to tie his makeshift hat in place. When he was done he had something that roughly resembled a hat, maybe if someone had made one that never had seen a hat and had only received descriptions from someone else who ALSO had never seen one you’d have something similar to what Wendel made. But it was enough of a hat to be called one and it worked passably for him, keeping the sun out of his eyes and off his nose and lips which were burnt by now, sensitive and stinging to touch. As he walked he considered the usefulness of his shirt as a hat against his own self as a meal. Both in death turned into something new, potentially beneficial for someone who could need it, but in the end he decided his shirt had fared better recycled. Though his shirt had won, he resolved himself into hoping he could become as useful as his hat had, just maybe without the dying part.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0124/>0124</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-01-23</p><br></h2><p>2023-01-23
On a cosmic scale it's easy to overlook small things. Like people. I think so many civilizations are so used to the idea that a person is essentially inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Countless empires have reigned and fallen without a single person impacting even their system of stars in a meaningful way. Sure, eventually some societies get there, but it’s a process, one that uses collective and compounding progress to build upon knowledge and reach. Upon capacity. Enough strength to affect a position of power in your universe is inconceivable to a single Finite mind, much less so in the span of less than eons. One person can’t make something happen quickly.

There was a lot to understand about the systems that lay stranded within the veil. Looking back on it we don’t know how it contained the area of the galaxy it did and in the way that it did when our universe is supposed to be moving. Everything was moving at least. Some have guessed that the multiversal connection event froze this motion prior to the veil’s appearance, that merely joining our realms stopped universal expansion.

The connections she could’ve gained didn’t matter to her as much as exploiting others' webs for profit.

“Article four, section twenty-seven. The opposing party may not demonstrate threat to the crown or stand in favor of threats or accomplices to such parties. Punishment is decided by the reigning judge. Death recommended.” As the speaker fell silent Ven felt at the heavy manacles and chains that bound him to the stone podium, somehow less insulting than being branded with treason. The empire was getting desperate. The eyes were on the judge as he sat in thought, unmovable mountain of a man shadowed in his white judicial robes. The judge fortunately was on his side. Sometimes bribery wasn’t about money as much as it was solving problems, and Ven was uniquely skilled at doing so. Judge Forethrell’s daughter had been silently captured and sold in an underground trafficking after the judge couldn’t pay ransom roughly a year ago. Horrible situation. But Ven had connections. He’d tracked down the girl and made a deal to get her out on the condition Forethrell makes the right decision today. He didn’t like working on conditional deals especially when people were being used as payment but the circumstances were dire. Forethrell caught Ven’s eyes and he could see the uncertainty from the judge, the cocktail of emotion laying just behind the stonelike facade. Ven nodded. All he could give was his assurance, and in that regard he was an honest man. Forethrell cleared his throat and stood, the chamber felt almost frozen in time as everyone held their breath for the verdict. Ven smiled and let out a sigh of relief, this whole situation had gotten a little too far out of hand. Forethrell’s thundering voice echoed through the hall, “I agree with the speaker, the opposing party before us did violate article four, section twenty-seven, that of treason and intent to usurp the crown.” Ven froze. Oh no. “In addition I will add charges of racketeering, bribery, human trafficking, grand thievery, accomplice to murder, and coordinating unlawful public protest under empire courts.” This is really bad. “The sentence is clear, the empire sentences Ven Rallet to death.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0130/>0130</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-02-04</p><br></h2><p>2023-02-04
Cera sat in the back of the boarded wagon, her hands and feet being bound by rope made it difficult to retain her balance when the wheels struck a rock or a divot, which was often. It was a long and uncomfortable ride so far through the backroads of the decaying county. Her couriers had no problem with damaged goods though and knowing that was exactly why she had kept her mouth shut throughout the trip. There had been a time when she assumed her words, her status, and ignorant condescension could weasel her out of any undesirable position. That had been a year ago. A very long year ago. She had learned a lot of painful lessons in that time and learned to be quiet. Turns out, being a grand judge’s daughter comes with as many pitfalls as it does advantages. For example, you could get the best selection of books the empire can offer in a stately library in your luxurious manor but then you could get kidnapped and sold as a slave when your father rules against a band of notorious thieves. So pretty give and take. She had tried to rest her head against the wood wall of the wagon but with how uneven this road was it was impossible to not get a headache. Bumpy and neglected roads meant she was in one of the outer cities of the empire, several days away still from the center, her home. Cera had liked to believe she was doing a decent job of keeping mental notes on where they were. Seeing the light filter in through slits in the planks allowed her to keep a rough track of time even when she slept. Her captors had clipped and sanded down her fingernails so she couldn’t chip at the wood to create larger gaps or work at her binds but she did try on occasion to simply peek through the little gaps in the frame, it was difficult to see anything. She felt she had a decent sense for where they were anyway. Less than a week away, at least she presumed. She was going home. The slavers had told her as much anyway. There was something akin to a deal at play she didn’t really understand, they didn’t really talk about it much either, but she didn’t need to know, she finally had hope. They were bringing her back to the capital, to her father. She could finally look forward to the future. She just had to get there in one piece. The wagon lurched to a stop causing her to tumble over and land on her shoulder, granting a painful new ache. After a moment lying there she could hear voices coming from the forward end. She clenched her jaw from the pain and wiggled upright and scooted towards the front of the hold so she could get in better earshot. Even with her ear to the wall she could barely hear. “You’re makin’ a hefty mistake.” That gravelly voice was Pipe, the wagon guard. The name was quite fitting, he was as hard headed as he was hollow. “I don’t think you understand the position you’re in, big man.” This voice was new to her. “You either give up what you got or we take your lives too.” The silence after that was thick. Was the wagon being robbed? What would happen if they found her? “What’s in the back?” The voice said. “Nothin’. S’ why you’re makin’ a mistake, we ain’t got nothin’.” Pipe said. Cera heard a whack and a grunt and then what sounded like Pipe groaning after. “We don’t appreciate being lied to.” The voice said. “We were tracking you for a bit, where’s the other one? Your friend.” Pipe seemed to be doing all the talking, but now that the voice mentioned it she still hadn’t heard Rib yet, her owner. She wondered if he took the chance to run when he saw an opportunity. She figured as much.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0131/>0131</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-02-04</p><br></h2><p>2023-02-04
Pipe continued to groan in pain. She heard a thump and winced and the sharp cry Pipe made. A part of her was glad to hear pain befall one of her slavers, that man and others had put her through worse, but a greater part of her was afraid. They were her last chance at getting home. “If he moves, kick him again. See what’s inside the back.” Seconds later a large blade hacked into the side of the wagon a few feet from where Cera sat, she barely suppressed a yelp. The wielder dislodged the weapon and rammed it down into the wood again, from her end it looked like the blade of a war axe. It was only a matter of time before they would be able to look into her cell here, she had to find a way to hide. She hesitantly scuttled towards the wall they were breaking open, hoping once they looked inward they wouldn’t look far enough in to see her in the corner, also hoping more men didn’t poke any extra holes in this side of the wagon, she was still wanting to remain in one piece. She closed her eyes for a moment, attempting to calm herself as the axe came down on the wood again and again, that terrible thwack, tearing open a hole in the wall. Once she heard the wood creak and rip she opened her eyes, blinding light poured into the dark little space, it was difficult to adjust to. It was immediately shadowed by a head looking into the new window. Cera pulled up her legs to her chest and tried to make herself as small as possible in the dark corner against the wall. “Huh, fella was right. Empty.” A new voice this time. The light returned as he left. Cera let out a very quiet sigh of relief, she hadn’t even realized she was holding her breath. “Then burn the wagon and kill him. Take the horse, there’s nothing else left for us here.” Her breath caught. She could hear Pipe pleading and whimpering then the familiar sound of that axe thwacking down. Silence. Then the sickening sound of the axe ripping out from Pipe’s corpse. Tears started running down her face. This is very bad. She was going to die in here, in this stupid little box. A blazing torch was tossed in through the opening and landed in the center of the floor.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0132/>0132</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-02-08</p><br></h2><p>2023-02-08
Cera watched in horror as the flames spread out from the torch and crawled out along the dry wooden planks of the wagon floor. She yelped and pressed her back against the wall, her head and bound wrists thudding against the hard surface. She had to get out of this stupid miserable little box otherwise she would die here, but how? Her wrists and ankles were bound and she had little time left before this cage and her within it would be reduced to smoldering ash, she didn’t have time to get through the thick hardwooded wall of the wagon. But she had to do something. She glanced to her left, seeing the jagged hole left by the axe. It was only slightly bigger than her head, she would never fit through. Though the more she looked at it, those sharp and splintered edges left from the axeblade might allow her to cut her bindings free. She felt at the rope around her wrists, she couldn’t wriggle her hands out from underneath her – these knots were properly tied – if she wanted to attempt to free herself she’d have to leverage her hands above the boards awkwardly behind her. What would happen if this even worked? Even if she freed her hands, even her feet after that, what could she do when this entire wagon was engulfed with flames? Don’t think about that, focus on this. Cera shuffled over to the window and peered out seeing a few figures riding away, one with a large bloodied axe resting on his back. She wouldn’t die to these thugs. She got to work once again, facing the sickeningly hot flames still spreading throughout the cabin and consuming the far wall, feasting on the wood and celebrating with roars of intensity. Her eyes burned and watered as she bent down lower towards the fire, trying her best to raise her hands up behind her to the hacked boards. She felt at the wood with her fingers, trying to feel around for a bit sharp enough. Cera had to start holding her breath as the smoke was eating up the available air. Her fingers sensed a point she felt could slice the binds so she raised up her wrists and pulled down with considerable force, the wood stabbing into her left palm instead of the rope. She exhaled sharply, too stunned to even scream. She closed her eyes, she felt her tears evaporate and steam away. Be strong. Again. Her hand hurt with a blinding pain but she shakingly raised it above the board again, feeling the blood drip from her palm. She held her hands there, face searing from the heat of the flames. If you don’t do this you will die. Try. She pulled down as hard as she could. She felt the rope sever and her hands pulled free from the force of the motion. She backed up into the wall away from the flames, holding her hand slick with blood. The wound was pretty bad, but she couldn’t worry about it now. The time had come to face the true reality of the situation, she was still just a girl trapped in a box on fire.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0133/>0133</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-02-10</p><br></h2><p>2023-02-10

This is it. The end of the road. Holding her bleeding hand and sat back against the wagon wall, Cera watched as the flames consumed the room and roared like the fire itself was a terrible living thing. And perhaps it was. She stared into the heart of the blaze trying to search out its soul. Was this an angry predator bent on rampage? Was it a starved beast? Was it a neutral creature that perhaps possessed no control over its own physical form? It was almost impossible to breathe now, the air was smoke and the heat was overwhelming. Her little section she sat in was the last not entirely consumed by fire. Through teary eyes she looked to the opposite wall, the flames had crawled up it and to the ceiling. This whole box was becoming fire. She hated her life. She decided that now. She hated that it all led up to this, all that pain for nothing. She was so close, after so much she was right there, she was almost free. Why did she even bother struggling through it all? What was hope if nothing but a traitor? When she was a child she enjoyed her life, the luxury, the freedom of being related to someone important. She was ignorant and a fool then. Perhaps that in itself was worth hating. But the last year had taught her that the world was a horrible place, far beyond comprehension. Kidnapped, becoming a slave, sold around, beaten, it had all taken its toll. She closed her eyes, maybe now she could be free of it all. Finally this endless and inescapable nightmare she had been stuck in could be over then, maybe this was a better ending for her than being led by hope’s siren melody. She opened her eyes again, looking at the fire. She finally understood. The fire’s soul was kind. This was an act of mercy.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0138/>0138</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-02-21</p><br></h2><p>2023-02-21
The far wall exploded and crumbled inward, a spray of ember and char flying out towards Cera. A large section had caved in, but it was difficult to see through the fire and smoke. Another blast resounded from that wall, then another, pieces of the planked wood flew about. “GIRL? YOU IN THERE?” She saw the glint of a two handed hammer through the now large hole in the wall as it struck another piece, shattering a section of the burnt and weakened wagon. That was Rib, he had actually come back. She sat dumbfounded for a moment, she had just accepted the end, her end. Did she still want to die now that there was a chance at life? Her life? Would she fall into hope’s comforting arms again? “HELLO?” Another blast from the hammer. “GIRL, YOU ALIVE?” “I’m here!” Cera tried yelling over the roar of the fire but her voice was weak, it probably didn’t carry very far. “Rib! Please-” A coughing fit took over, she thought she could see him trying to peer into the wagon searching for her voice. “GIRL, YOU GOTTA RUN TO ME NOW, THE WALL IS OPEN.” She froze. Run through all that fire? Would she even make it? “THERE’S NO TIME, GO! THE DAMN CEILING IS COMING DOWN!” The wagon was large, but she could vault through couldn’t she? It wouldn’t take her longer than a second or so to get through, but that is all it took, all of that was burning, a healthy flame fueled and fed, bright and powerful. She stood up slowly, her skin felt burned, her body ached, especially her shoulder, her hand was flaring sharp pains. Would this be any worse than sitting in here and letting it happen? “G O!” Cera wrapped her hands around herself and launched forward through the flames with as much speed and energy she could muster. As soon as her first foot landed she felt herself twist and fall, a broken board underneath her pulling her down. Oh no. She tumbled to the ground hard and rolled forward, she felt hands immediately grab her and pull her out of the wagon, she hit the hard earth with a thud, knocking the wind out of her. Rib was patting her down with some blanket or jacket, something, she was sure her clothes were either burning or at least smoldering. She tried taking a deep breath but was rewarded with weak coughs instead. Regardless of the pain or the coughs, she was glad she didn’t die in that stupid wagon. She had coped with the reality she was facing in those final moments, but it’s not what she wanted. Not truly. She hated the last year, she hated what she had gone through, she was sure she was going to hate what stood ahead. But she would get through. She promised herself that now. She’d make all of this mean something.
Rib pulled her hands together forcibly, the burned flesh and bleeding wound causing Cera’s vision to flash in pain, he tied her hands together with a length of rope sending signals of pain that made her want to vomit. “Not letting you out of my sight this time, girl. If you die,” Rib pulled the rope bindings taut, “then I don’t get paid.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0139/>0139</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-03-01</p><br></h2><p>2023-03-01

“I just don’t like seeing you in this much pain.” Silvena held Nym’s cheek, “You worry me.”
“Me too… I worry I’ll get there to only find a dead end.”
“I wish things were different, Nym. This isn’t the life we wanted, we didn’t want to be out here playing rebels. I know things have been taken from us Nym – from humanity – but sometimes I just wish we could forget our roles in all this and appreciate the life we have. I know that’s wishful..”

The shadow of grief hung behind the soldiers like a cloak, shielding them from the inevitability of consequences they were about to bring upon their world. Marching through those halls with terrible purpose freed the mind of distracting and meaningless ideas of repercussion. They would worry with what came after. When the mourning was done. There’s nothing more dangerous than a unified force behind a shared value, when the painful thread between them has been spun the inertia of such topples mountains as easily as empires.

Sellira closed the door to her room and bolted the lock. She lingered, a hand on the frame, her mind blank. For a moment she simply was, nothing more. She let out a deep breath and slid down to the floor, resting her head against the wall and closing her eyes. Rest. Finally. The last few days had been draining in a way she had never really experienced, pushing the bounds of what she was capable of living through as a human being. That bastard Modin had been in a particularly sour mood as of late and for whatever reason she was in his line of sight. Someone has to be. She reluctantly opened her eyes and reached to pull off her shoes. Everything ached, but especially her feet. All that walking and standing in these tight insufferable constricting little feet prisons. She threw her shoes across the room and let her head fall against the door frame again. How much more could she take? Not much more. After some time she crawled over to her bed, a lavish looking frame with the most uncomfortable mattress in the kingdom. She reached under the nightmare of a bed and unstrapped her notebook from underneath. “No one who ever changed the world did it while sleeping.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0145/>0145</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-04-04</p><br></h2><p>2023-04-04

“The truth, child, has been distorted over the years. I can’t give you answers I know to be true.. but I believe they came from our people, ascended into the stars.

Petyl closed her notebook softly, another entry finished. It was exhausting. Everyone thought of her Sight as a gift, to her it was a burden. Her hand caressed the leather booklet, so many precious dreams recorded. So much of it riddled with self doubt. Dreams were impossible to fully catch, to fully memorize. She felt like an amateur forger blocking in shapes of a beautiful painting and missing the details, the strokes, the colors. The life of it. When she woke up every day she could feel the visions draining out of her head like there was a hole in the back of her skull. Maybe there was somewhere. She closed her eyes, seeing the last vestiges of those fragile scenes play out before her in imperfect memory and emotion. A girl trapped in a box on fire. A man with a severed shadow. A wielder of a blade surrounded by a perfect darkness. These images stood out from the rest today, a moment longer for each, a searing sunspot, each image burned. This was rare for her but not unfamiliar, there had been others before that had stayed frozen in memory. She bound her notebook in her favorite red ribbon and gently put it in her bag. Something bothered her about her most recent witness though, an inescapable dread that continued to creep up and spread over the images like a virulent corruption, darkened veins growing through them. Something was wrong with those scenes. Something unseen. An external presence beyond her own. Something else was watching.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0148/>0148</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-04-09</p><br></h2><p>2023-04-09
In the end Fin chose to trust. To sleep. Whether it was the desperation and exhaustion he felt or the smoldering wick signaling the end of his days, something within him stopped worrying about the danger the stranger could have possessed. It was a strange conclusion Fin came to, realizing that in these potentially final moments he simply didn’t care. He would rather sleep and face the consequences that came with it. Even death. Fin both thanked and apologized to the stranger and bundled up near the base of one of the colorless trees, knife covertly kept in hand. For a while he kept an eye open, watching the strange fellow stare into the fire. It wasn’t long before he drifted away, lost in his questions about the soul that watched over him. Fin dreamt that night. He was thrown into chaotic abstract nothingness, running from an unseen force, attempting to chase things, unable to move. Some dreams persist only for moments, these dreams felt like years, tormenting labyrinths just putting him back at the start. And then clarity. Fin stood on the deck of a ship surrounded by a partially frozen ocean, icebergs jutting out of the water creating a sort of chasm the ship was sailing through. He had never seen anything like it. He felt the piercing cold, the crisp sharpness to the air. He walked to the railing of the wooden deck, it was a large ship, the water lapped against the hull far down below. “Breathtaking isn’t it?” Fin looked to his right, a person now stood there, hands clasped onto the railing and looking out alongside him. Fin nodded. The man turned to him and smiled, judging from the wrinkles the man was much older, short gray hair atop his head waved softly from the sea breeze. He donned a strange white cloak in a style he had never seen before. “Have you thought about what comes after, Fin?” “Sorry? After what?” “After you are cured.” Fin shook his head and took a deep breath, “I never thought about it. After all this time running towards the finish line, I never really wondered about where I’d run to after.” “I think that’s a very human response from someone that’s been in such distress.” The man turned away, looking back over the side of the ship at the now falling snow disappear into the waves below. “But time is running out, Fin. Think about the path you would travel after. Is your life worth saving over another?” “Is there such a thing? A life worth more than another?” “A question I have spent too long avoiding the answer to.” Fin didn’t know how to respond to that, so he watched the snow fall as well and after some time he felt the scene slip away from him, falling into wakefulness.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0149/>0149</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-04-11</p><br></h2><p>2023-04-11
“So what, the guy fell asleep and just got to talk with a god or something? Then screwed it up?”
“Interesting people in interesting situations make for interesting stories, Kedrel.” Riv said. “But I think you’re missing the point of this story so far regardless.” Leading the other two, Riv had picked up a large approximately-straight stick at some point and was absently tapping the forest floor ahead of him to help guide their way through the pervasive darkness, picking out gnarled roots and rocks effective at tripping blinded travelers. “You’d think with one diminished sense, the others would have heightened for you.”
“Yeah, yeah, the guy is dying. I get it. You mentioned it a hundred times.” Kedrel said. “He’s gonna realize the value of life or something after that.”
“The point, Ked,” Rallyn said, “was that when Fin finally opened himself up to new ideas, to being able to trust, he was rewarded with connection. So far at least..”
“Ah” Riv said, whacking at a root with his improvised cane, “someone was paying attention.”
Rallyn smirked, looking to the side and barely catching Kedrel roll his eyes at her in the dark. She liked being right. Still though, it didn’t directly answer any of her earlier questions to Riv about the Divide, it was again an ‘answer’ that only created more questions. She was beginning to doubt the end of the story would offer any more useful explanations, just more vague metaphors.
“Whatever.” Kedrel grumbled. “How much longer do we have to walk through this nightmare? Where are we going exactly?”
Riv stopped abruptly, almost causing the other two to bump into him. “Here should probably do it actually, now that you mention it.” He said. Rallyn watched curiously as Riv waved the other two back a few steps and then lifted the large walking stick over his head and thrust it down into the earth. She wasn’t sure but Rallyn thought she saw the branch fade gray for a single moment as it struck. After releasing his grip on the wood it seemed to hold firm by itself, implanted within the ground a lot deeper than Rallyn would’ve thought. He pushed at it lightly to see if it would topple, seeming satisfied with its sturdiness he turned around to face the other two, his expression unreadable. “Let’s go.”
“We came all this way for that?” Kedrel said. “That’s it?”
“That’s it. I told Tem I didn’t need escorts.”
“What is this for exactly?” Rallyn asked, studying the pole and squinting at it to see if the gray effect she had seen was in her head. Could it have been light?
“It will serve as a reminder for the.. person who will find it. And yes. They will.” Riv said, starting to walk back in the direction they had come. “Let’s hurry, neither of you can be out past the Divide much longer, especially now.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0150/>0150</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-04-21</p><br></h2><p>2023-04-21
There were many pivotal moments in our discoveries, but one serves as a particularly haunting point of exposition. We saw something we weren’t supposed to. That deep uncontrollable feeling of dread still never leaves me, seeing those EYES stare back at me on the screen. Those unknown and incomprehensible eyes. I’ve gone through periods in my life where I’ve tried my best to forget those eyes, to banish them completely from my mind. I couldn’t live another day seeing them pierce and cut through my consciousness as if it were embossed with them. My ravenous longing to forget led me to consider even taking my own life, though thankfully in the end it was just drugs and other devices I chose as weapons in the war to destroy my mind. It was all a fruitless effort, in the end it was the eyes that remained alight at the center of my library of memories, the brilliant flame burning away my other recollections into the dust. And there were other times where I became obsessed, losing control to that scene – that imperishable image – that played forever in the forefront of my mind. Painting and etching them over and over again on my walls, yearning to recapture the essence of whatever evil that was gazing back at me and yet, even amidst my starved compulsion, still failing to do so. The frustration of such I remember feeling well. How was I able to not forget yet not fully remember? ‘Remember’ was the wrong word, though I didn’t know it at the time. The mind simply wasn’t able to understand what it was seeing at the time. It couldn’t comprehend. It was like trying to visualize a color I had never seen or rewriting a book in a language I had never known. I felt like I was doomed to live in my exasperating and rampant fanaticism without an end. And it felt that way for a long while, though its grip on me has since been replaced with other horrors. That day stands out from the others as the first time I felt true soul crushing fear about what we were doing. We should have stopped then.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0151/>0151</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-04-25</p><br></h2><p>2023-04-25
Perin felt comfortable past the Divide, free. A liberated part of the world which held no direct contempt for him anymore. His new life was strange by all measures, but it felt right. He was somebody now. He made changes in the world. He was important. He prowled through the darkness, his little notebook held out in front of him. Light behaved differently here, so when the red ink on the top of the page glowed, it instead grayed itself out. It was light enough to see compared to the thick shadow around it, but still dull compared to what it would look like on the other side, a gleaming crimson. A gray line was forming from the bottom of the page as he walked, inking itself upward towards the dot. An interactive map of sorts. Interesting that the dot at the top did not turn into a line itself, moving around the page. He was hunting a person, not a place. What would a pulser be doing past the Divide this long? “Hey, next time how about we do this on a real map, you know, with pictures?” The word ‘Ungrateful’ slowly formed on the other open page. “I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I was the one being ungrateful, when’s the last time I heard a ‘thank you Perin’?” No words formed. Perin smiled. It was amazing how easy it was to get under the skin of a god. How human they felt. “It’s okay, I forgive you, I’m sure you’re just nervous to be around someone so divine.” Perin said. “Maybe draw some symbols next time, you know, for scale. With how long I’ve been walking you’d think I’d be going to Elrin.” ’Limited.’ Perin hummed as a response. The god’s limitations were profound, hence the need for Perin’s involvement, but it was still baffling to him. Every action the god did or didn’t take only made Perin’s mental image of that limiting line blurrier. Sometimes he was sure the god preferred it that way. “It’s okay, I knew a lad who was limited, he drew pictures just fine. Maybe that’s the key to artistry my friend, just stand behind a horse like he did.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0152/>0152</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-04-27</p><br></h2><p>2023-04-27
Ryn spent the next hour or so treading carefully towards the distant light, keeping low. The light turned out to be a fire pit of considerable size set up in a small plaza or courtyard as a welcome piece to a tall wooden gate. This had to be what she was looking for. The Hideout. She approached the edge of darkness, staying careful to remain on her side of that line, her heart thumping in her ears as she did so. The gate was closed – she assumed locked – and was several times taller than she was. She had never seen a construction as primitive as this in the citadel, why build a gate with wood? What was the point with something so soft? She couldn’t tell how far the walls extended off into the darkness, this place wasn’t necessarily small, but a little more runty than she was hoping. She realized she couldn’t help but feel skeptical. Places of legend and myth are always made to be grander in the stories, but this place seemed just so basic and primeval. How would rebels fight back or defend with wood? Would these people even take her in? Would she want to be taken in? She tried to calm herself with a deep breath. This is what she had wanted, this is why she had left the citadel, to find a place away from the seers. At any cost. There was no returning to whatever life she had back there. This was it. Part of Ryn felt betrayed by her own willingness to abandon her home in search of her escapist fantasy and fanciful ideas of a promising rebel empire but another part felt extremely validated, she had actually escaped and found it. Maybe. She definitely found something. Regardless, she wasn’t thrilled about the idea of wanting to walk in blind into yet another potentially unfavorable situation so she found a hiding spot in a large patch of bushes within distant eyeshot of the gate and settled down for the night. Maybe in the morning she could see more about what this place was and who these people were.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0153/>0153</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-05-03</p><br></h2><p>2023-05-03
Khri stood on the steps of the star temple, the sky orb cradled in both hands. This was it. After hundreds of years someone from the dwellers finally had one of the powers that had made the gods so deific, one of the very things that had separated her people from the stars. She held it in her very hands. Looking into the orb she could see cracks and sparks of lightning shoot around, small flashes of light illuminating the deepness within it, streaks of mist and clouds swirling around endlessly together – it felt like she was holding the sky itself as it stormed, the vastness inside seemed incomprehensible.
Her people had fought and died for this, suffered through centuries of enslavement. An incalculable amount of dwellers' lives thrown away. The importance of such was not lost on her, though holding this relic here and now only made her resent it. How can something so small have caused so much pain? For what? Was this orb worth her people’s lives? Her father’s life? It took a lot for Khri not to just smash the orb – be done with it – but that would be a waste to everyone who sacrificed their lives for her to have this, she couldn’t. It didn’t change how she felt about it, but she vowed to keep it safe. She held the orb close to her heart. “Please Aarand, do your part,” she said, “don’t let this be in vain.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0154/>0154</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-05-09</p><br></h2><p>2023-05-09
“Sir, reports show a high compression zone at sector 96B, mismatched output frequencies are cre-“
“You can stop with all that. You know I can’t follow it. Just send someone to fix it or whatever the fuck.”
“Yes sir.”
Captain Zarin slumped back in his chair and watched the officer hurry out of the room. Reports were becoming too complex and scientific, he just didn’t care. These days it was less about warfare tactics and domination and more about watching the damn rocks in the sky turn. He put his feet up on the station desk, looking out of the bridge window, seeing the planet below. When did everything get so boring?
Where did someone like him go when the war was over? When the conquesting was done? He felt like a caged silvear – apex predator forced into dysfunctional domestication. Zarin cast his eyes across the landscape below, it was a spectacular view that he found difficult to appreciate these days. The skies were clear, the view of the city below unimpeded. He decided to pull the ships in closer this cycle, staying within atmosphere instead of out in orbit. Sometimes he liked watching them with his own eyes instead of through screens. It felt more real that way. It was sometimes easy to forget he was playing god with real people.
Maybe it was simply that the fate of a conqueror was an unfair one. You either end up a failure and likely dead or a ruler with nothing left to pursue, trapped within the nauseating product of your success. He was a fantastic builder that constructed his own prison. At least his prison had a view.
A notification ping sounded from the panel next to him. He groaned and looked over.
1 Arrival of recruitment carrier transport imminent. Huh. That was today. Zarin slowly took his feet down off the desk and stood up, straightening out his jacket, time to meet the new recruit. Draft them into damnation. He opened the notification message on the panel, expanding details. The recruit’s name was Aarand Vullan. Zarin dismissed the message and took one more long look out at the city of Windfall sitting below before marching out of the bridge to meet the new kid.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0155/>0155</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-05-11</p><br></h2><p>2023-05-11
A few officers were bustling around Zarin as he stood patiently, hands held together behind his back. The docking bay gate was just ahead, the carrier transport had just landed. It wasn’t often they received new recruitment off schedule cycles, but to keep the systems alive you needed infusions, and crew was your blood. Even still, it was an oddly timed request for a single recruit. Typically batches of recruits were hailed and sent from the main home system, spreading out their coverage of influence like spokes, today was different.
The bay gate door slid open, several officers in standard white uniform leading a young man in a bright blue jumpsuit. At sight of the captain the officers saluted, pressing their right fist to their left shoulder.
“Relax,” Zarin said, “just want to meet the recruit.” The officers took the cue and promptly walked away. “Well Aarand Vullan, welcome aboard the Empyrean. I’m Captain Zarin.”
Aarand bowed slightly. “Thank you for taking me in, sir.”
Zarin winced at the sight of the bow. “What sector are you from, Vullan?”
“Minerva, sir.”
“The sector that went dark recently, right?”
Aarand hesitated slightly, “That is correct, sir.”
“Stop with the sirs.” Zarin said, “But I guess that explains it, a refugee, we normally don’t get unscheduled recruitment out here.” He narrowed his eyes at Aarand. “How bad is it out there?”
“The sector went rogue, captain. Total anarchy. The veil hit harder there than most places we heard about. Felt like an inevitability.”
“Why sign yourself up for the fleets then?” Zarin asked. “You got out, you’re just running back into the same system, kid.”
Aarand spent a moment in contemplation. “I wanted to change things. Didn’t want to sit by and watch anymore.”
Zarin sighed, well that’s fucking disappointing. Another bright eyed kid who thought they had the potential and desire to change the universe for the better. This was the wrong place to sign up for that. But Minerva, that was interesting. A sector that broke free. Unconquered.
“I want a comprehensive report sent through your station officer about Minerva.” Zarin said sharply, he could see Aarand stand up straighter at his sudden change of tone. “We don’t receive many reports or messages from the outer sectors, especially not Minerva. I want to know what factors led to its collapse and a list of the major players and factions fighting for control. Estimates for each on firepower, fleet statuses, and manpower.”
Aarand bowed quickly. “I’ll do my best, anything else captain?”
“No,” Zarin said, waving over Aarand’s supervising officer. “and learn to salute. You’re a part of the Empyrean crew now, time to act like it.”<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0156/>0156</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-05-31</p><br></h2><p>2023-05-31
Aarand followed in line behind his escort officer down the halls of the Empyrean. He hadn’t been here long but already any notions of him being a wolf in sheep’s clothing had vanished completely. He was in over his head. He was a sheep in a wolf's den.
He did well to conceal his awe at the overwhelming size of the ship and architecture. The ceilings reached up to heights of tall multi level buildings, the hallways were as wide as roads. The hangar he had landed in felt the size of a small town and that was one solitary room, even that was filled with other smaller ships of varying size and power, all of which were capable of unstoppable force. How could anyone fight against this? His people were more unprepared than he thought. Unprepared was the wrong word he realized, it insinuated there would ever be a chance for his people in a battle. How many millions of years would his people need to progress to be in the same league as this?
Everything was larger here, but it wasn’t just that, the walls were made of colored metal, electric lights, panels and machines, doors that opened themselves for you the ship felt alive. He had seen a castle, he had seen cities made of wood and stone, but in comparison the memories of them felt cold and lifeless. Weak.
From below, the Empyrean felt like the size of a moon, and perhaps it was. It was a capital ship after all, Aarand could get a better view of it sometimes when it hung low in orbit, but size proportion and distance did him a disservice. He was never prepared for how truly large and intricate this place was. How many thousands – maybe hundreds of thousands – of people lived here on this living vessel? How many other ships were there with millions and millions more people? Aarand’s head began to swim. They turned left down a hallway marked with an orange stripe running along the lower edge of the walls.
“This is living quarters H, or LQ-H. This is gonna be your new LQ designation.” The officer had a small panel device in his hand as he talked, flipping his thumb across it. “Your room is going to be.. erm.. 406. Here.” The officer motioned for Aarand’s hand and he offered it forward hesitantly.
The officer held the small panel device forward over Aarand’s palm, a pattern of light shining across it. “What’s this for?”
The officer gave him a quizzical look, “Do things different over in Minerva huh? This is a bio sig scan. And.. there you go, you’re in the system. Your room door will know your bio sig and allow you in but no one else.”
Aarand took back his hand and looked it over, no marking or anything. Interesting.
“I’m just inputting your sig into LQ-H.. aaand yeah, there you go, you’ll have access to all the LQ living features: cafeteria, exercise center, simulacrum training, the social area, etc. You'll just have to have a look around when you get a spare chance, I don’t have time to show you everything today, you kinda caught us by surprise.” The officer chuckled softly.
Aarand had no idea what a cafeteria or simulacrum training area was but he didn’t ask. He had to stick to only asking questions he needed the answers to. Internally he winced for asking what the ‘bio sig’ was for already. Can’t be too suspicious, though because he was allegedly from a dark sector he guessed he had some leeway on this. Aarand nodded to the officer. At least he could guess what an exercise center would be.
They started to walk through the orange LQ area which quickly opened up the hallways into balconies that looked down upon a massive area that spread out wide and far with a rolling field covered in grass and trees. He thought he could see to the other side of the field, but by that point the trees looked tiny, almost barely noticeable. He realized what made this scene look wrong in his head was that it looked so much like the fields and forests from the planet that it was strange to see the horizon sky made of metal instead.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/0157/>0157</a><p id=dateFrmt>2023-06-02</p><br></h2><p>2023-06-02
Aarand stepped back into his own personal room aboard the Empyrean capital ship, a small vegetable wrap held in his hands. He had gone down to the cafeteria to scout his new home of LQ-H a bit more. The orange halls were surprisingly easy to navigate, everything was labeled well, the flow was controlled, it made sense. He didn’t interact with any of the other residents but had again received a lot of stares and questioning looks at his blue jumpsuit. He didn’t have to push through any crowds of people but there were definitely jumpsuited men and women everywhere he looked, typical numbers of what he’d see down on the streets of Windfall. Something he had remembered one of the officers saying was that it was indeed rare for recruits to be inducted into the Empyrean at these cycles, it was undoubtedly drawing some unwanted attention. Hopefully his cover story could hold. Overall he had made it back to his room without incident. At least he hoped so.
He sat down in front of his own personal panel, taking a bite out of the wrap. In a very short amount of time he had learned a lot about how to fake his position, but the panels were something that still loomed over him. Something every person here interacted with almost constantly. He thought back on the recruitment officer, Erat, and how much time he spent looking at his hand panel instead of anything around him, even Aarand himself. He needed to learn this.
He tapped the screen, lighting it up, words started appearing on the screen.
Hello Aarand, I am Pixie, your own personal panel assistant.
Aarand took a bite out of his wrap, thinking. Was Pixie a real person? Or were they a synthetic machine person within the panel itself? Something he heard was possible. With the insane scope of what the Empyrean was, he would believe either.
It seems like you’re new to the system, let me check up on that.. Yep, it seems like you were just admitted today. Welcome to the Empyrean! Shall we begin onboarding procedures?
Aarand grunted and swiped on the panel, he had seen everyone do it. Sure enough the screen flashed to a new green color.
Great! You clearly know how to use panels already! We can skip through basic tutorials!
“Wait-” Aarand said, trying to swipe the screen the other way. What did he just do?<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/Armedius/>Armedius</a><p id=dateFrmt></p><br></h2><p><br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/Don/>Don</a><p id=dateFrmt></p><br></h2><p><br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/Pavel/>Pavel</a><p id=dateFrmt></p><br></h2><p><br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/Pipe/>Pipe</a><p id=dateFrmt></p><br></h2><p><br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/Rallyn/>Rallyn</a><p id=dateFrmt></p><br></h2><p><br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/README/>README</a><p id=dateFrmt>raceLore R</p><br></h2><p>raceLore Repo for storing Race's Lore alerts with an Obsidian Vault for creating a connection map.

15 &lt;link rel=&34;shortcut icon&34; href=&34;icon.png&34; type=&34;image/png&34;> The default can be overridden by defining a value to the favicon key in your data/config.yaml file. For example, here is a ListDictionary example format, which is equivalent to the default:
favicon:- {rel:&34;shortcut icon&34;, href:&34;icon.png&34;, type:&34;image/png&34;} - { ... } Repeat for each additional favicon you want to addIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.
If you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it may be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the Apple touch icon to Quartz's default favicon:
favicon:|&lt;link rel=&34;shortcut icon&34; href=&34;icon.png&34; type=&34;image/png&34;> &lt;link rel=&34;apple-touch-icon&34; sizes=&34;180x180&34; href=&34;/apple-touch-icon.png&34;>This second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your webpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more information about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read this article.
Note that all generated favicon paths, defined by the href attribute, are relative to the static/ directory.
Graph View To customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around data/graphConfig.yaml.

You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing assets/styles/custom.scss. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in /layouts/partials.
Partials Partials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in /layouts.
For example, the structure of the home page can be edited through /layouts/index.html. To customize the footer, you can edit /layouts/partials/footer.html
More info about partials on Hugo's website.

Language Support CJK + Latex Support (测试) comes out of the box with Quartz.
Want to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.
Follow the steps Hugo provides here and modify your config.toml
For example:
1 2 3 4 5 6 defaultContentLanguage = &39;ar&39; languages languages.ar languagedirection = &39;rtl&39; title = &39;مدونتي&39; weight = 1<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/custom-Domain/>Custom Domain</a><p id=dateFrmt>Registrar</p><br></h2><p>Registrar This step is only applicable if you are using a custom domain! If you are using a &lt;YOUR-USERNAME>.github.io domain, you can skip this step.
For this last bit to take effect, you also need to create a CNAME record with the DNS provider you register your domain with (i.e. NameCheap, Google Domains).
GitHub has some documentation on this, but the tldr; is to
Go to your forked repository (github.com/&lt;YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/quartz) settings page and go to the Pages tab. Under "Custom domain&rdquo;, type your custom domain, then click Save.
Go to your DNS Provider and create a CNAME record that points from your domain to &lt;YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io. (yes, with the trailing period).
Example Configuration for Quartz
Wait 30 minutes to an hour for the network changes to kick in.
Done!<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/hosting/>Deploying Quartz to the Web</a><p id=dateFrmt>Hosting on</p><br></h2><p>Hosting on GitHub Pages Quartz is designed to be effortless to deploy. If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.
Enable GitHub Actions Permissions By default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.
Head to Settings > Action > General > Workflow Permissions and choose Read and Write Permissions
!notes/images/github-actions.png Enable GitHub Actions
Enable GitHub Pages Head to the &lsquo;Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the &lsquo;Pages' tab.
(IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from master (and not hugo) using / (root) Set a custom domain here if you have one! Enable GitHub Pages
Pushing Changes To see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a git repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Navigate to Quartz folder cd &lt;path-to-quartz> Commit all changes git add . git commit -m &34;message describing changes&34; Push to GitHub to update site git push origin hugo Note: we specifically push to the hugo branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the master branch for redeployment.
Setting up the Site Now let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.
Here, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change baseURL in /config.toml.
Make sure that your baseURL has a trailing /!
Reference config.toml here
1 baseURL = &34;https://&lt;YOUR-DOMAIN>/&34; If you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. &lt;YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.github.io/quartz), include the trailing /. You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!
1 baseURL = &34;https://&lt;YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.github.io/quartz/&34; Change cname in /.github/workflows/deploy.yaml. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use &lt;YOUR-USERNAME>.github.io.
Please note that the cname field should not have any path e.g. end with /quartz or have a trailing /.
Reference deploy.yaml here

Ignoring Files Only want to publish a subset of all of your notes? Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.
❌ Excluding pages from being published
Docker Support If you don't want to use a hosting service, you can host using Docker instead! I would not use this method unless you know what you are doing.
Now that your Quartz is live, let's figure out how to make Quartz really yours!
Step 6: 🎨 Customizing Quartz
Having problems? Checkout our FAQ and Troubleshooting guide.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/editing/>Editing Content in Quartz</a><p id=dateFrmt>Editing Qu</p><br></h2><p>Editing Quartz runs on top of Hugo so all notes are written in Markdown.
Folder Structure Here's a rough overview of what's what.
All content in your garden can found in the /content folder. To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.
To edit the main home page, open /content/index.md.
Front Matter Hugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so, otherwise the generated page will not have a title!
You can also add tags here as well.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ---title:&34;Example Title&34;tags:- example-tag---Rest of your content here... Obsidian I recommend using Obsidian as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.
This step is highly recommended.
🔗 Step 3: How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz
Previewing Changes This step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet. This is highly recommended but not required.
👀 Step 4: Preview Quartz Changes
For those who like to live life more on the edge, viewing the garden through Obsidian gets you pretty close to the real thing.
Publishing Changes Now that you know the basics of managing your digital garden using Quartz, you can publish it to the internet!
🌍 Step 5: Hosting Quartz online!
Having problems? Checkout our FAQ and Troubleshooting guide.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/docker/>Hosting with Docker</a><p id=dateFrmt>If you wan</p><br></h2><p>If you want to host Quartz on a machine without using a webpage hosting service, it may be easier to install Docker Compose and follow the instructions below than to install Quartz's dependencies manually.
Hosting Quartz Locally You can serve Quartz locally at http://localhost:1313 with the following script, replacing /path/to/quartz with the actual path to your Quartz folder.
docker-compose.yml
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 services: quartz-hugo: image: ghcr.io/jackyzha0/quartz:hugo containername: quartz-hugo volumes: - /path/to/quartz:/quartz ports: - 1313:1313 optional environment: - HUGOBIND=0.0.0.0 - HUGOBASEURL=http://localhost - HUGOPORT=1313 - HUGOAPPENDPORT=true - HUGOLIVERELOADPORT=-1 Then run with: docker-compose up -d in the same directory as your docker-compose.yml file.
While the container is running, you can update the quartz fork with: docker exec -it quartz-hugo make update.
Exposing Your Container to the Internet To Your Public IP Address with Port Forwarding (insecure) Assuming you are already familiar with port forwarding and setting it up with your router model:
You should set the environment variable HUGOBASEURL=http://your-public-ip and then start your container. Set up port forwarding on your router from port p to your-local-ip:1313. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at http://your-public-ip:p. However, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and this method is not secure.
To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine. Buy a custom domain (say, your-domain.com) from Cloudflare. Point a DNS A record from your-domain.com to your public IP address and enable the proxy. Set the environment variables HUGOBASEURL=https://your-domain.com, HUGOPORT=443, and HUGOAPPENDPORT=false. Change 1313:1313 to 443:443 for the ports in docker-compose.yml. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at https://your-domain.com! To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy If you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like Traefik. Be sure to configure your TLS certificates too!<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/ignore-notes/>Ignoring Notes</a><p id=dateFrmt>Quartz Ign</p><br></h2><p>Quartz Ignore Edit ignoreFiles in config.toml to include paths you'd like to exclude from being rendered.
1 2 3 4 5 6 ... ignoreFiles = &34;/content/templates/&34;, &34;/content/private/&34;, &34;&lt;your path here>&34; ignoreFiles supports the use of Regular Expressions (RegEx) so you can ignore patterns as well (e.g. ignoring all .pngs by doing \\.png$). To ignore a specific file, you can also add the tag draft: true to the frontmatter of a note.
1 2 3 4 5 --- title: Some Private Note draft: true --- ... More details in Hugo's documentation.
Global Ignore However, just adding to the ignoreFiles will only prevent the page from being access through Quartz. If you want to prevent the file from being pushed to GitHub (for example if you have a public repository), you need to also add the path to the .gitignore file at the root of the repository.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/obsidian/>Obsidian Vault Integration</a><p id=dateFrmt>Setup Obsi</p><br></h2><p>Setup Obsidian is the preferred way to use Quartz. You can either create a new Obsidian Vault or link one that your already have.
New Vault If you don't have an existing Vault, download Obsidian and create a new Vault in the /content folder that you created and cloned during the setup step.
Linking an existing Vault The easiest way to use an existing Vault is to copy all of your files (directory and hierarchies intact) into the /content folder.
Settings Great, now that you have your Obsidian linked to your Quartz, let's fix some settings so that they play well.
Open Settings > Files & Links and look for these two items:
Set the New link format to Absolute Path in vault. If you have a completely flat vault (no folders), this step isn't necessary. Turn on the Automatically update internal links setting. !notes/images/obsidian-settings.pngObsidian Settings
Templates Inserting front matter everytime you want to create a new Note gets annoying really quickly. Luckily, Obsidian supports templates which makes inserting new content really easily.
!WARNING
If you decide to overwrite the /content folder completely, don't remove the /content/templates folder!
Head over to Options > Core Plugins and enable the Templates plugin. Then go to Options > Hotkeys and set a hotkey for &lsquo;Insert Template' (I recommend cmd+T). That way, when you create a new note, you can just press the hotkey for a new template and be ready to go!
👀 Step 4: Preview Quartz Changes<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/preview-changes/>Preview Changes</a><p id=dateFrmt>If you'd l</p><br></h2><p>If you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following instructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.
Install hugo-obsidian This step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have Go (>= 1.16) installed.
1 2 Install and link hugo-obsidian locally go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest If you are running into an error saying that command not found: hugo-obsidian, make sure you set your GOPATH correctly (see notes/troubleshootingcommand not found: hugo-obsidian|the troubleshooting page)! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.
Installing Hugo Hugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. Install Hugo with "extended&rdquo; Sass/SCSS version first. Then,
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Navigate to your local Quartz folder cd &lt;location-of-your-local-quartz> Start local server make serve View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/ !INFO Docker Support
If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing hugo-obsidian and hugo. Instead, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run make docker
Afterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated! Now, let's get it hosted online.

Why Quartz? Hosting a public digital garden isn't easy. There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like Notion, Roam, and Obsidian, yet none of them have super easy to use free tools to publish that garden to the world.
I've personally found that
It's nice to access notes from anywhere Having a public digital garden invites open conversations It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge playful and fun I was really inspired by Bianca and Joel's digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.
The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple. You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/search/>Search</a><p id=dateFrmt>Quartz sup</p><br></h2><p>Quartz supports two modes of searching through content.
Full-text Full-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that exactly match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.
1 2 the default optionenableSemanticSearch:false Natural Language Natural language search is powered by Operand. It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.
Natural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.
Here's how to set it up.
Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under "Indexes&rdquo;, enter the name and description of your index, and click "Create Index&rdquo;. Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like uqv1duxxbdxu. Click into the index you've created. Under "Index Something&rdquo;, select "SITEMAP&rdquo; from the dropdown and click "Add Source&rdquo;. For the "Sitemap.xml URL&rdquo;, put your deployed site's base URL followed by sitemap.xml. For example, for quartz.jzhao.xyz, put https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml. Leave the URL Regex empty. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under "API Keys&rdquo;, you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click "Create API Key&rdquo;. You'll need this for the next step. Open data/config.yaml. Set enableSemanticSearch to true, operandApiKey to your copied key, and operandIndexId to the ID of the index we created from earlier.. 1 2 3 4 5 the default optionsearch:enableSemanticSearch:trueoperandApiKey:&34;jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf&34;operandIndexId:&34;s0kf3bd6tldw&34; Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

If you are unfamiliar, this resource is a great place to start!
Forking A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
Navigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:
📁 Quartz Repository
Then, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. Make sure that when you fork, you uncheck the &lsquo;Copy the hugo branch only' option.
If you don't have an account, you can make on for free here. More details about forking a repo can be found on GitHub's documentation.
!notes/images/fork.png
Cloning After you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have git, then type the following command in your terminal replacing YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username.
1 git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz Editing Great! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden. If you're ready to start writing content already, check out the recommended flow for editing notes in Quartz.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.
While you're here, join our Discord :)
Does Quartz have Latex support? Yes! See CJK + Latex Support (测试) for a brief demo.
Can I use &lt;Obsidian Plugin> in Quartz? Unless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.
The easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.
My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz Make sure you set the source to deploy from master (and not hugo) using / (root)! See more in the hosting guide
Some of my pages have &lsquo;January 1, 0001' as the last modified date This is a problem caused by git treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.
1 2 3 4 5 in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml) git config core.ignorecase true or globally (not recommended) git config --global core.ignorecase true Can I publish only a subset of my pages? Yes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on excluding pages from being published.
Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages? Yes! All built files can be found under /public in the master branch. More details under hosting.
command not found: hugo-obsidian Make sure you set your GOPATH correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.
1 2 3 4 5 6 Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bashprofile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac) export GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH In your current terminal, to reload the session source ~/.bashprofile again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac) How come my notes aren't being rendered? You probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup Obsidian to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in the &lsquo;how to edit' guide.
My custom domain isn't working! Walk through the steps in the hosting guide again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.
How do I setup analytics? Quartz by default uses Plausible for analytics.
If you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this guide in the Hugo documentation.
Alternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by following this guide.
How do I change the content on the home page? To edit the main home page, open /content/index.md.
How do I change the colours? You can change the theme by editing assets/custom.scss. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the customization guide.
How do I add images? You can put images anywhere in the /content folder.
1 2 Example image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png) !Example Image(/content/notes/images/example.png) My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date By default, the linkIndex.json (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on local editing
Can I use React/Vue/some other framework? Not out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing /layouts/default/single.html but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.
Still Stuck? Quartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on Twitter and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.
🐛 Submit an Issue<br></p></div><br><div id=preview-container><h2 id=entry-title><a href=https://marktullius.github.io/RaceLoreVault/notes/updating/>Updating</a><p id=dateFrmt>Haven't up</p><br></h2><p>Haven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations? On Unix/Mac systems you can run the following command for a one-line update! This command will show you a log summary of all commits since you last updated, press q to acknowledge this. Then, it will show you each change in turn and press y to accept the patch or n to reject it. Usually you should press y for most of these unless it conflicts with existing changes you've made!
1 make update Or, if you don't want the interactive parts and just want to force update your local garden (this assumed that you are okay with some of your personalizations been overriden!)
1 make update-force Or, manually checkout the changes yourself.
!warning Warning!
If you customized the files in data/, or anything inside layouts/, your customization may be overwritten! Make sure you have a copy of these changes if you don't want to lose them.
